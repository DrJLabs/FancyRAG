# Project Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for Codex CLI.

## Workflow Rules

- Use normal git branches for work; do not use git worktrees for isolation.
- After any update/push to an existing PR branch, post review triggers as separate comments: `@codex review` and `/gemini review` (initial PR creation does not require this).
