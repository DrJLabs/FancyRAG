# Product Owner Validation: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)
Status: Ready for Review â†’ Approved

## Validation Summary
- Story supports Epic 1 objective by delivering the `.env` template and automation guardrails referenced in docs/bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md and docs/prd.md#epic-1--environment--workspace.
- Acceptance Criteria cover template content, documentation updates, model defaults, and CI enforcement, aligning with architecture guidance in docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations and docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack.
- Dev Notes provide operators and developers with required Neo4j, Qdrant, and OpenAI context without re-reading architecture shards; references remain accurate.
- Tasks/Subtasks enumerate template drafting, doc updates, and automated checks, each mapped to acceptance criteria and supported by testing expectations.
- QA artifacts (risk profile, test design) are now present to guide implementation and downstream gating.

## Observations
- Documentation and guard tests are now in place; QA artifacts (risk, test design, trace, NFR) all PASS.
- Maintain CI enforcement for guard suite and revisit if new env keys are added.

## Decision
APPROVED.
