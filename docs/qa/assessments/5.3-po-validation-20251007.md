# Story 5.3 Product Owner Validation – Automate Stack Lifecycle Workflows

**Date:** 2025-10-07T19:45:00-07:00  
**Validated By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** GO

## Summary
- Unified automation entry point (`make service-run`, `service-rollback`, `service-reset`) now orchestrates bootstrap → ingest → export → evaluation → teardown with structured logs and artefact capture. Evidence: `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py::test_service_run_smoke` plus the latest `service_run.json` artefact.
- Guarded rollback is verified through dedicated regression (`tests/unit/fancyrag/cli/test_service_workflow.py::test_service_rollback_invokes_cleanup`), guaranteeing Neo4j/Qdrant cleanup and Docker volume teardown without manual intervention.
- Failure handling no longer leaks secrets; sanitisation is enforced by `tests/unit/fancyrag/cli/test_service_workflow.py::test_stage_failure_sanitizes_summary`, aligning with security expectations.
- Documentation and architecture shards have been updated (`docs/brownfield-architecture.md`) to describe the automation surface, smoke baseline (<35s), and operator guidance, satisfying AC4.

## Template Compliance
- **Status:** PASS  
- **Notes:** Story status, QA results, gate, trace, and NFR artefacts are in sync. Preset defaults and rollback behaviour are documented for operators.

## Critical Issues
- None.

## Should Fix
- None — OPS-185 remains on the watch list but does not block release.

## Nice to Have
- Capture an additional smoke artefact under the "full" preset once Story 5.4 lands to expand baseline telemetry.

## Anti-Hallucination Review
- All referenced artefacts exist in-repo; acceptance criteria confirmed against `docs/prd.md#story-53-automate-stack-lifecycle-workflows` and epic updates.

## Assessment
- **Readiness Score:** 10  
- **Confidence:** High

## Next Steps
- Mark Story 5.3 as Done and continue with remaining Epic 5 stories (5.4–5.6).
