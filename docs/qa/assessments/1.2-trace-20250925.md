# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.2 â€“ Environment Configuration Template

### Coverage Summary
- Total Requirements: 4
- Fully Covered: 4 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: `.env.example` enumerates placeholders for OpenAI API access, Neo4j Bolt credentials, and Qdrant endpoint/API key with inline guardrails.
- Coverage: FULL
- Test Mappings:
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_contains_required_keys
    given: `.env.example` exists in repo root
    when: The template is parsed for key=value entries
    then: Required OpenAI, Neo4j, and Qdrant keys are present exactly once
    coverage: unit
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_placeholders_are_safe
    given: Placeholder values are read from `.env.example`
    when: Values are inspected for prefixes
    then: Placeholders use `YOUR_` guardrails and never include realistic secrets
    coverage: unit

#### AC2: Documentation instructs operators to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, explains each variable, and reinforces secrets stay out of version control.
- Coverage: FULL
- Test Mappings:
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_documentation_references_env_template_workflow
    given: `docs/architecture/overview.md` content is loaded
    when: The Environment Configuration section is scanned
    then: Instructions include copy workflow, default model guidance, and "never commit" warning
    coverage: unit

#### AC3: Guidance captures default OpenAI model selections (`gpt-4o-mini` default, optional `gpt-4.1-mini`) and references service endpoints.
- Coverage: FULL
- Test Mappings:
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_models_document_optional_upgrade
    given: The OPENAI model line in `.env.example`
    when: The comment is evaluated
    then: Default `gpt-4o-mini` and optional `gpt-4.1-mini` override are documented
    coverage: unit
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_endpoint_guidance
    given: Endpoint placeholders from `.env.example`
    when: URI formats are validated
    then: Neo4j uses Bolt scheme and Qdrant uses HTTPS URL as referenced in docs
    coverage: unit

#### AC4: Automated validation ensures repository tooling fails if required `.env` keys are missing.
- Coverage: FULL
- Test Mappings:
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_contains_required_keys
    given: The template is parsed
    when: Key set compared to authoritative list
    then: Missing keys are detected with assertion failure
    coverage: unit
  - test_file: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_placeholders_are_safe
    given: Placeholder enforcement guard is executed
    when: Unsafe substitutions occur
    then: Test fails, ensuring CI guard will block regressions
    coverage: unit

### Critical Gaps
- None detected.

### Test Design Recommendations
1. Keep the unit guard suite in CI to enforce template integrity on every commit.
2. Extend integration coverage in future if `.env` loader gains additional processing (e.g., schema validation).

### Risk Assessment
- All acceptance criteria have deterministic unit coverage; residual risk is low provided guard tests remain mandatory in CI.
