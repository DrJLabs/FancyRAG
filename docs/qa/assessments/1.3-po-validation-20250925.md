# Product Owner Validation: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)
Status: Ready for Review → Approved

## Validation Summary
- Story 1.3 advances Epic 1 by delivering the diagnostics command and audit artifact required for reproducible workspace verification, consistent with docs/bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md#stories and docs/prd.md#epic-1--environment--workspace.
- Acceptance Criteria now cover dependency import coverage, provenance report contents (including `importlib.metadata` usage and SHA-256 hashing), documentation handoff, and regression tests—each mapped to supporting architecture shards (docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/architecture/source-tree.md, docs/architecture/overview.md).
- Tasks/Subtasks enumerate CLI implementation, report generation, bootstrap messaging, documentation updates, and dual-layer testing with explicit schema assertions, providing actionable guidance for the dev agent.
- Dev Notes cite prior story insights, logging/observability requirements, provenance expectations, and testing directives with verifiable references; no placeholders remain.
- QA artifacts (risk profile, test design, trace, NFR, gate) are present under `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-*` and `docs/qa/gates/1.3-environment-validation-command.yml`, ensuring downstream gating alignment.

## Observations
- Risk profile highlights two high risks (dependency detection and secret redaction); tasks/test matrix already address mitigations—ensure implementation preserves explicit module mapping and redaction tests.
- Integration scenario 1.3-INT-009 requires `.gitignore` enforcement; confirm repo already ignores `artifacts/` path (currently satisfied via existing `.gitignore`). Document remains clear that operators should not commit diagnostics artifacts.
- Sample `versions.json` schema has been documented in `docs/architecture/overview.md` (Workspace Verification section) to support operator comparisons. No further action needed unless schema changes.

## Decision
APPROVED.
