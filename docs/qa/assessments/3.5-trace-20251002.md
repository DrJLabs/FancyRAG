# Traceability Assessment – Story 3.5 (Semantic Enrichment Pipeline & Retrieval Surfacing)

Date: 2025-10-02
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Summary
- All four acceptance criteria map to concrete code updates and automated tests.
- Semantic enrichment is optional and feature-flagged, preserving default minimal-path behaviour while enabling richer context when required.
- QA and run logs now include semantic metrics, ensuring deviations surface quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| AC | Implementation Evidence | Test Coverage | Status |
|----|-------------------------|---------------|--------|
| 1  | `scripts/kg_build.py`: `--enable-semantic` flag, `_run_semantic_enrichment`, provenance tagging (`semantic_source`, `chunk_uid`, checksums). | `tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py::test_run_with_semantic_enrichment` verifies semantic stats/timeouts and log content. | ✅ |
| 2  | `QaThresholds` extended with semantic thresholds; evaluator persists metrics (`metrics["semantic"]`) and enforces rollback on failure. | Same unit test plus manual run log inspection shows semantic metrics serialized; QA gate file references thresholds. | ✅ |
| 3  | `scripts/ask_qdrant.py`: `--include-semantic` flag and `_fetch_semantic_context` enrichment; docs/architecture/overview.md updated with operator guidance. | `tests/unit/scripts/test_ask_qdrant.py::test_main_includes_semantic_context` asserts semantic payload returned. | ✅ |
| 4  | Story file Testing section references unit suites and docs lint; risk/test design artifacts recorded. | `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`, `tests/unit/scripts/test_ask_qdrant.py`; `scripts.check_docs --strict` run captured in debug log. | ✅ |

## Additional Notes
- Semantic provenance uses consistent `semantic_source` tag for downstream queries.
- QA metrics integrate with existing ingestion report version `ingestion-qa-report/v1` to avoid breaking consumers.

## Conclusion
Traceability COMPLETE. All acceptance criteria have implementation and automated validation.
