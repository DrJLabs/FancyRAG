# NFR Assessment: Story 3.2 – Ingestion QA Telemetry & Quality Gate

Date: 2025-10-02
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)

## Summary

- Security: PASS – QA artifacts sanitized using shared scrubber with regression test ensuring reports omit absolute `/tmp/` paths and secret-like strings.
- Performance: MONITOR – QA runtime now recorded via `qa_evaluation_ms` (QA section) and `qa.duration_ms` (run log); capture baseline for larger corpora when available.
- Reliability: PASS – Threshold evaluator enforces rollback on anomalies; unit tests cover success/failure paths.
- Maintainability: PASS – Versioned report schema, CLI flags, and documentation updated for operators.

## Detail

### Security (Pass)
- Evidence: Sanitization regression in `tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py::test_run_pipeline_success` confirms JSON/Markdown reports exclude absolute `/tmp/` paths.
- Action: None.

### Performance (Monitor)
- Evidence: QA duration metrics recorded for each run; still awaiting baseline data for large corpora.
- Action: Record runtime delta on representative dataset when integration smoke is re-enabled.

### Reliability (Pass)
- Evidence: Rollback path validated in `test_run_fails_on_qa_threshold`; QA report creation asserts artifact presence for directory ingestion.
- Action: Extend compose smoke to run QA-enabled path when Docker + OpenAI credentials available.

### Maintainability (Pass)
- Evidence: Documentation and CLI flags describe QA workflow; tests provide coverage for evaluator logic.
- Action: None.
