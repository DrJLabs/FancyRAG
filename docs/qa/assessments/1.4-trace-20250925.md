# Traceability Matrix: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

| Acceptance Criterion | Implementation Artifacts | Test Coverage | Notes |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-------|
| AC1: Guard requires explicit override path with prior status logging | src/cli/stories.py (`guard_next_story`, CLI parser); .bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md updated workflow | tests/unit/cli/test_stories.py::test_guard_blocks_when_previous_story_not_done; tests/integration/cli/test_story_override_cli.py::test_cli_requires_override_when_previous_story_not_done | CLI command emits blocking error without override flag. |
| AC2: Override captures risk acknowledgement and references prior story | src/cli/stories.py note insertion & log; docs/bmad/story-overrides.md; story Dev Notes override block | tests/unit/cli/test_stories.py::test_guard_records_override_and_inserts_note; tests/integration/cli/test_story_override_cli.py::test_cli_override_updates_story_and_log | Risk acknowledgement inserted with timestamp; log entry persisted. |
| AC3: Documentation explains override workflow and mitigation steps | docs/bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md#story-override-workflow; AGENTS.md Scrum Master commands | Manual review (INT-003 in test design) | Documentation updated; future automation could lint references. |
| AC4: Automated tests cover blocking, override confirmation, rejection + logging | src/cli/stories.py; tests suite additions | pytest targets run: `tests/unit -q`, `tests/integration/cli -q`, targeted bootstrap regressions | CI command list recorded in story Debug Log references. |

## Summary
- All ACs traced to both implementation and verification artifacts.
- Manual doc validation called out for AC3 until lint automation is introduced.
