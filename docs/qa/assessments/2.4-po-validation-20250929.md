Date: 2025-09-29
Product Owner: Sarah (PO)
Status: Approved – Ready for Done

## Alignment Check

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story statement & ACs reflect epic goal | ✅ | Acceptance criteria capture compose asset delivery, health checks, documentation runbooks, and automation aligned with the epic success criteria. |
| Tasks/Subtasks actionable & mapped to ACs | ✅ | Task list includes compose authoring, doc updates, automation hooks, `.env` adjustments, and parity checklist; each references supporting architecture shards. |
| Dev Notes completeness & references | ✅ | Dev Notes cite Story 2.3 completion and Story 2.5 dependency so sequencing is explicit; architecture references cover data persistence, service endpoints, and logging/secret rules. |
| QA coverage in place | ✅ | Risk profile and test design documents exist with P0 scenarios for compose lint, health checks, smoke workflow, and doc verification. |
| Dependencies & overrides acknowledged | ✅ (with follow-up) | Override history noted; Story 2.5 must land scripts before closing AC4 smoke automation. Tracking this in Dev Notes is sufficient, but reiterate in implementation plan. |

## Observations & Follow-Ups
1. **Smoke automation dependency:** Current smoke harness runs with placeholder scripts shipped in Story 2.4; reopen follow-up once Story 2.5 upgrades ingestion. Documented in parity checklist.
2. **Production parity checklist:** Completed at `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-production-parity-checklist.md`; monitor outstanding checklist items as enhancements.
3. **CI resource limits:** Workflow serialises compose job; revisit if runners show contention after Story 2.5.

## Decision
- **Approved – Ready for Done.** ACs satisfied, QA gate PASS, and documentation updated; remaining enhancements tracked in parity checklist and future stories.

## Notes for Dev Agent
- Track parity checklist items during ongoing maintenance and coordinate with QA when Story 2.5 replaces stubbed scripts so smoke assertions can tighten.
