Date: 2025-09-28
Product Owner: Sarah (PO)
Status: Approved — Done

## Scope Reviewed

## Alignment Check

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story statement & ACs match epic intent | ✅ | Acceptance criteria reflect the epic’s expectations for a shared OpenAI wrapper, readiness probe parity, configuration guidance, and full test coverage. |
| Tasks/Subtasks actionable & traceable | ✅ | Tasks map cleanly to ACs and reference appropriate architecture shards; migration notes and documentation updates are explicitly listed. |
| Dev Notes completeness | ✅ (with follow-up) | Dev Notes capture prior-story insights, architecture references, and testing requirements. Track async client decision (already noted) to avoid lingering TODO. |
| Risks & QA coverage | ✅ | QA risk/test design assessments exist with clear mitigations; story now references them. |
| Dependencies / sequencing | ✅ | Story 2.4 can proceed once 2.3 changes land; follow-up fixtures and allowlist audit are live. |

## Issues & Follow-Ups
No outstanding follow-ups. Async decision logged, readiness-probe fixtures captured, and CI allowlist audit scheduled (2025-09-29).

## Decision
- **Approved — Done.** Story 2.3 satisfies epic alignment, documentation updates, and QA guidance; proceed to closure.

## Notes for Dev Agent
- Monitor CI allowlist audit outputs weekly and update fixtures/tests if the readiness probe schema changes.
- Keep readiness-probe golden fixtures (`tests/fixtures/openai_probe`) updated when probe outputs change.
- Track async needs in future stories; open new work if concurrency requirements emerge.
