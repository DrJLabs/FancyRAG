# PO Validation: Story 2.3 – OpenAI Shared Client Abstraction

Date: 2025-09-28
Product Owner: Sarah (PO)
Status: Approved with follow-ups

## Alignment Check

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story statement & ACs match epic intent | ✅ | Acceptance criteria reflect the epic’s expectations for a shared OpenAI wrapper, readiness probe parity, configuration guidance, and full test coverage. |
| Tasks/Subtasks actionable & traceable | ✅ | Tasks map cleanly to ACs and reference appropriate architecture shards; migration notes and documentation updates are explicitly listed. |
| Dev Notes completeness | ✅ (with follow-up) | Dev Notes capture prior-story insights, architecture references, and testing requirements. Track async client decision (already noted) to avoid lingering TODO. |
| Risks & QA coverage | ✅ | QA risk/test design assessments exist with clear mitigations; story now references them. |
| Dependencies / sequencing | ⚠️ | Story 2.4 drafted while 2.3 remains Draft; development must finish 2.3 before executing 2.4’s automation scripts. |

## Issues & Follow-Ups
1. **Async Strategy:** Ensure the open question results in a definitive decision or follow-on work item before marking story Done. Owner: Product Owner (tracked in story follow-up tasks).
2. **Override Log:** Story already flagged that 2.4 proceeded under override; coordinate with Scrum Master to close the loop once 2.3 is in progress/done. Owner: Scrum Master.
3. **Metrics Fixture Generation:** Capture golden metrics/artifact fixtures prior to readiness-probe refactor (per researcher recommendation) to maintain dashboard parity. Owner: QA/Dev.

## Decision
- **Approved with follow-ups.** Story 2.3 is ready for development once async decision and metrics fixture work are scheduled. No blockers identified.

## Notes for Dev Agent
- Implement tasks in the documented order to preserve readiness-probe compatibility.
- Prioritise P0 tests from QA matrix before merging; ensure fallback retries and secret masking audits are exercised.
- Coordinate with observability to validate metrics fixtures post-change.
