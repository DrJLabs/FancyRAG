# Product Owner Validation: Story 2.1

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)
Status: Draft → Ready for Dev Handoff

## Validation Summary
- Story advances Epic 2 objectives by enforcing GPT-4.1 mini as the baseline chat model, documenting gpt-4o-mini as the constrained fallback, and aligning configuration guidance with docs/prd.md#epic-2---models--vectors and docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration.
- Acceptance Criteria now cover chat allowlists, embedding dimension enforcement with override guardrails, Prometheus/Grafana alertability, and automated tests for configuration, embeddings, telemetry, and logging per docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations.
- Tasks/Subtasks provide clear implementation guidance for configuration loader, embedding helper, telemetry instrumentation, documentation updates, and pytest coverage, each mapped to relevant architecture shards.
- QA artifacts—risk profile, test design (updated with override rejection and p95 telemetry checks), and researcher validation—are in place, ensuring implementation teams understand priority scenarios and observability requirements.
- Dev Notes reference predecessor stories and architecture context so engineers can reuse established logging/masking patterns without re-scoping requirements.

## Observations
- Grafana alert playbook automation now lands alongside CI coverage; allowlist audit has been deprioritised per stakeholder guidance.
- Traceability and NFR assessments have been completed; continue monitoring optional documentation lint improvements.

## Decision
APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT.
