# NFR Assessment: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary
Diagnostics workflow satisfies observability, security, and operability expectations for Epic 1. Automated verification surfaces dependency drift within the 30-minute bootstrap SLA while protecting secrets and keeping artifacts out of version control.

## Evaluation

### Reliability & Availability
- Diagnostics command exits non-zero when dependencies are missing (`tests/integration/cli/test_environment_diagnostics.py::test_workspace_diagnostics_fails_on_missing_dependency`).
- Bootstrap `--verify` option ensures operators capture a fresh report immediately after provisioning.
- Recommendation: monitor CI runs for recurring dependency failures; risk logged under OPS-301.

### Performance
- Tooling operates locally and should complete in <1 minute. No long-running operations; reliance on import checks only.
- No additional performance testing required beyond existing unit/integration coverage.

### Security & Privacy
- Secrets redacted from output (`tests/unit/cli/test_diagnostics.py::test_output_redacts_secret`).
- `.gitignore` prevents `artifacts/` reports from being committed; integration test asserts cleanliness.
- No secrets stored in generated JSON; only metadata and version info.

### Observability & Auditability
- Report includes Python version, package versions, lockfile SHA-256, and git SHA.
- Documentation now includes sample payload for operators (docs/architecture/overview.md#workspace-verification).

### Operability
- Diagnostics command packaged under `python -m cli.diagnostics workspace`; accessible from activated venv.
- Bootstrap notes instruct rerunning diagnostics after setup; ensures human workflow alignment.

### Residual Risks
- Dependency rename drift requires updating module→distribution mapping (Risk TECH-301 monitored).
- Operators must keep `.env` secrets consistent; failure would surface in subsequent stories (outside current scope).

## Decision
PASS – Non-functional requirements satisfied.
