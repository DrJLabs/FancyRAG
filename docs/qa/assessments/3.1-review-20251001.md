# QA Review â€“ Story 3.1 (adaptive-chunking)

Date: 2025-10-01
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Adaptive chunking presets, directory ingestion, and metadata propagation implemented with comprehensive unit coverage.
- Documentation updated to reflect new CLI usage; structured logs now expose per-file and per-chunk telemetry for operators.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py tests/unit/scripts/test_export_to_qdrant.py`
- Updated documentation: README.md, docs/architecture/overview.md
- Story file: docs/stories/3.1.adaptive-chunking.md

## Issues & Actions
- **Performance monitor:** No automated token budget estimator yet. Recommend future enhancement (captured under NFR monitor).
- No blocking defects observed; metadata appears consistent across ingest/export code paths.

## Recommendation
- Proceed to gate evaluation with a PASS (monitor) status acknowledging the performance follow-up.
