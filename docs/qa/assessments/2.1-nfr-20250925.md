# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Guardrails block unsupported models, redact telemetry payloads, and reuse diagnostics masking patterns; no exposed secrets observed in tests.
- Performance: PASS – Prometheus exporters, Grafana thresholds (`docs/alerts/openai-telemetry.yml`), and CI enforcement via `tests/unit/alerts/test_openai_alert_thresholds.py` keep latency/token budgets monitored.
- Reliability: PASS – Embedding dimension enforcement, override logging, and Prometheus counters provide early detection of drift; tests cover mismatch and override misuse flows.
- Maintainability: PASS – New settings/telemetry modules are unit-tested, isolated, and wired through structured logging for observability.

## Critical Issues
- None identified.

## Quick Wins
- Create markdown/doc lint to ensure cost envelope guidance stays in sync with story requirements.

## Recommendations
- Consider adding integration test once vector CLI consumes telemetry module, ensuring metrics remain scrape-ready.
