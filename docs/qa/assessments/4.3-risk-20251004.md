# Risk Profile: Story 4.3 (Caching Splitter Module)

Date: 2025-10-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary
- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 1
- Overall Risk Posture: Low-to-Moderate; mitigations rely on regression tests suited for local deployments.

## Context
Story 4.3 relocates the `CachingFixedSizeSplitter` (and helpers) from `fancyrag.kg.pipeline` into `src/fancyrag/splitters/caching_fixed_size.py`, introducing a typed configuration factory that upstream callers can reuse. The refactor must keep cache scoping, UID regeneration, and chunk metadata generation identical so the pipeline and QA flows remain stable.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID   | Category   | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001  | Technical  | Splitter extraction regresses scoped caching semantics, causing duplicate or stale chunk reuse downstream | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| DATA-001  | Data       | Post-refactor chunk UID / checksum metadata diverges from cache blueprints, breaking QA attribution in Neo4j | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001   | Operational| Managed-service stack adopts module without rerunning integration smoke, masking environment-specific regressions | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk Details & Mitigations

### TECH-001 – Scoped caching regression (Score 6, High)
- **Affected components:** `src/fancyrag/splitters/caching_fixed_size.py`, `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py`, tests under `tests/unit/fancyrag/*`
- **Drivers:** Re-introducing splitter via factory risks losing edge cases covered implicitly when the class lived in the pipeline (e.g., nested scopes, pydantic config passthrough).
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Maintain direct unit coverage of cache warm/reuse (`tests/unit/fancyrag/splitters/test_caching_fixed_size.py`), adding regression cases for multi-scope reuse if new behaviours appear.
  - Keep pipeline tests asserting `splitter.get_cached` parity after ingestion loops.
  - Monitor upcoming integration smoke runs for chunk count deltas per source.
- **Residual Risk:** Low once integration smoke rerun confirms parity.

### DATA-001 – Chunk metadata drift (Score 4, Medium)
- **Affected components:** `_build_chunk_metadata`, QA logging, Neo4j ingestion writers.
- **Drivers:** Cache blueprint serialization now occurs in a separate module; mismatches could mean chunk metadata references stale UIDs, leading to QA false negatives or missing chunk graphs.
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Ensure tests validate UID regeneration and metadata checksums (existing unit test verifies regenerate + pipeline test covers metadata path).
  - Add lightweight assertion in QA ingestion path verifying cached chunks emit unique UIDs prior to writing to Neo4j.
  - When running the optional integration smoke, compare QA reports before/after to spot regressions.
- **Residual Risk:** Medium until additional QA assertions/metrics land.

### OPS-001 – Optional integration smoke coverage (Score 2, Low)
- **Affected components:** Release process, integration smoke workflow, documentation handoff.
- **Drivers:** Integration smoke runs are not part of the regular personal workflow; skipping them could allow subtle regressions to slip by when local environment changes occur.
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Keep documentation references to the smoke test handy for manual execution when major local configuration or dependency changes are introduced.
  - Capture smoke-test learnings in docs if run ad hoc.
- **Residual Risk:** Low; manual smoke runs remain optional guardrails.

## Recommendations Summary
- **Must Fix Before Merge:**
  - Preserve scoped caching semantics with targeted unit tests and ensure pipeline loop exercises cache reuse (addresses TECH-001).
- **Monitor Post-Merge:**
  - Validate QA metadata integrity and chunk UID uniqueness during next integration smoke (DATA-001).
- Encourage occasional integration smoke execution after significant local changes (OPS-001).

```

## Residual & Follow-up Actions
- Run the integration smoke on-demand whenever substantial local environment changes warrant it.
- Capture backlog item for QA assertion covering unique chunk UIDs after cache reuse.
- Share risk profile with Product Owner/Dev to ensure mitigations enter the epic coordination board.
