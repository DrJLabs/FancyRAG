# NFR Assessment: Story 4.7

Date: 2025-10-05
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Security
- Status: Pass
- Notes: `bootstrap_environment` centralises required secret enforcement; failure paths continue to exit with clear messaging. No new credential logging introduced.

## Performance
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Schema/env helpers perform single-shot filesystem reads and cached lookups. No hot-path loops or additional network calls.

## Reliability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Unit coverage plus the minimal-path smoke on 2025-10-05 validate bootstrap sequencing and schema loading under Docker-backed stack.

## Maintainability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Schema/env logic moved into dedicated modules with explicit exports and targeted tests; documentation shards updated to match structure, reducing hidden coupling.

## Observability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: CLI/script logging unchanged; error messages for missing env vars remain actionable.

## Action Items
1. Schedule schema override regression for Story 4.8 to exercise custom path resolution (reliability + maintainability).
2. Keep integration smoke in weekly rotation to ensure `.env` discovery remains stable.
