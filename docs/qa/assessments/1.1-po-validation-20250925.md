# Product Owner Validation: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)
Status: Draft-Ready â†’ Approved with Follow-ups

## Validation Summary
- Story aligns with Epic 1 goal of standardizing the Python workspace bootstrap and reflects architecture constraints from docs/architecture/tech-stack.md and docs/architecture/source-tree.md.
- Acceptance Criteria are actionable and map directly to script behavior, lockfile creation, validation sanity checks, and documentation reminders.
- Dev Notes capture all required context so development can execute without re-reading architecture shards; no missing references identified.
- Tasks/Subtasks enumerate implementation and testing work, including documentation updates and integration tests; matches testing expectations documented in docs/architecture/coding-standards.md.
- QA artifacts (risk profile, test design) linked in QA Results ensure downstream traceability.

## Observations & Recommendations
1. Keep README/bootstrap usage update highlighted in tasks prioritized so AC4 remains satisfied when implementation lands.
2. Ensure CI plan includes lockfile drift detection per risk recommendations before marking gate PASS.
3. Confirm final implementation updates `docs/qa/gates/1.1-workspace-bootstrap-script.yml` to PASS after mitigations complete.

## Decision
APPROVED with noted follow-ups prior to gate transition.
