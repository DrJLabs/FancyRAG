# Story 5.2 Product Owner Validation – Centralise Typed Settings

**Date:** 2025-10-07T05:45:00-07:00  
**Validated By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** GO

## Summary
- Typed settings aggregate and CLI integrations now rely exclusively on the new `FancyRAGSettings` loader with caching and refresh behaviour validated by unit and CLI regression tests.  
- Documentation addendum for the `.env` migration checklist is enforced by the new lint rule, ensuring operators receive the correct upgrade steps and mapping guidance.  
- QA gate, NFR assessment, and risk register all show PASS with no remaining gaps; automation evidence resides in `docs/qa/assessments/5.2-*` and the targeted pytest run recorded in QA results.

## Template Compliance
- **Status:** PASS  
- **Notes:** Story remains aligned with PRD references, QA Results capture automated evidence, and Dev Notes document follow-on work completed during remediation.

## Critical Issues
- None.

## Should Fix
- None — ongoing monitoring deferred to future stories introducing additional typed settings fields.

## Nice to Have
- Capture an integration smoke run once the local stack credentials are available to provide artefacts alongside the unit/CLI regressions.

## Anti-Hallucination Review
- All artefacts reference in-repo sources (`src/config/settings.py`, `scripts/check_docs.py`, targeted pytest suites, and Epic 5 shard updates); no external dependencies or unsupported assumptions detected.

## Assessment
- **Readiness Score:** 10  
- **Confidence:** High

## Next Steps
- Proceed to mark Story 5.2 as Done and hand off to QA/Dev leads for any downstream integration tasks (e.g., full-stack smoke execution during the next release window).
