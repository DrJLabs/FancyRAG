# QA Review: Story 2.3 â€“ OpenAI Shared Client Abstraction

Date: 2025-09-28
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
- Code: `src/cli/openai_client.py`, `src/cli/diagnostics.py`, `src/config/settings.py`
- Tests: `tests/unit/cli/test_openai_client.py`, `tests/unit/cli/test_openai_probe.py`, `tests/unit/config/test_openai_settings.py`, `tests/integration/cli/test_openai_probe_cli.py`
- Documentation: `.env.example`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`, `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`

## Summary Assessment
- **Alignment:** Implementation meets all four acceptance criteria; shared client consolidates guardrails and readiness probe retains backwards-compatible artefacts.
- **Code Quality:** Structure is modular, telemetry/logging consistent, and retry logic honours `Retry-After`. No security leaks observed.
- **Test Coverage:** Nine P0 unit tests and three integration tests pass, covering fallback enforcement, retry/backoff, embedding validation, and probe regression.
- **Documentation:** Environment template, architecture overview, and coding standards updated to describe new controls and usage expectations.

## Key Findings
- No blocking issues detected.
- Follow-ups already tracked in story/researcher logs (metrics fixture diff, async strategy decision, scheduled allowlist audit). Monitor completion before closing epic.

## Recommendation
- Status: Ready for Done once identified follow-up tasks are scheduled/owned (QA to verify in subsequent cycle).
