date: 2025-10-02T10:45:00-07:00
validated_by: Sarah (Product Owner)
status: GO
summary:
  - Story scope directly addresses the outstanding documentation lint follow-up from Story 3.3 and aligns with Epic 3 Definition of Done.
  - Tasks cover implementation, automation hook-up, documentation updates, and tests mapped to ACs; QA risk profile + test design already published (docs/qa/assessments/3.4-risk-20251002.md, docs/qa/assessments/3.4-test-design-20251002.md).
  - Dev Notes reference the correct architecture shards (overview, source-tree, coding standards) and avoid unsupported assumptions.

template_compliance:
  status: PASS
  notes:
    - All template sections present; no placeholder text detected.

critical_issues:
  - none

should_fix:
  - none

nice_to_have:
  - Consider adding an explicit pointer in Dev Notes to the planned fixture directory under `tests/fixtures/docs_lint/` once created, to guide future updates.

anti_hallucination:
  findings:
    - Verified that every cited source exists and matches story guidance.
    - No undocumented libraries or patterns introduced.

assessment:
  readiness_score: 8
  confidence: High

next_steps:
  - Proceed to development, ensuring TECH-001 mitigation from the QA risk profile is implemented first.
  - Re-run QA gate after implementation to confirm lint coverage and CI integration.
