# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 3.3 (native-qdrant-retriever)

Date: 2025-10-02
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Security
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Retrieval still uses environment-sourced credentials (OpenAI, Neo4j, Qdrant). No new secrets are logged; sanitized artifact structure remains unchanged and continues to flow through the existing scrubber.

## Performance
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Retriever consolidates the two-step query into a single library call without increasing request volume. Vector search top-k remains configurable and test coverage ensures no accidental additional queries.

## Reliability
- Status: MONITOR
- Rationale: Unit tests cover retriever wiring and error paths, and a manual CLI run against the local stack returned expected matches. Integration smoke currently skips without OpenAI API keys; rerun once credentials are present to confirm end-to-end behaviour with real embeddings.

## Maintainability
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Code now relies on official GraphRAG abstraction, reducing custom logic. Tests mock the retriever boundary, and documentation explains configuration knobs for operators.

## Recommendations
- Re-run `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py` in CI or locally once OpenAI credentials are provisioned to clear the MONITOR flag on reliability.
- Consider adding markdown/doc lint checks so future documentation updates required by AC5 are automatically verified.
