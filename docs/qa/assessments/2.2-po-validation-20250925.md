# Product Owner Validation: Story 2.2

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)
Status: Draft → Approved with follow-ups

## Validation Summary
- Story 2.2 now captures the complete readiness probe scope for Epic 2 by enforcing sanitized artifacts, metrics export, and guardrail verification, aligning with docs/prd.md#epic-2---models--vectors and docs/architecture/overview.md#workspace-verification.
- Acceptance Criteria explicitly require exponential backoff for 429/`RateLimitError` responses, Prometheus histogram buckets spanning 100 ms–5 s, and documentation/test coverage for probe operation—each mirrored by actionable subtasks. (`docs/stories/2.2.openai-readiness-probe.md:14-26`)
- Testing directives enumerate success, fallback, rate-limit, histogram, and redaction scenarios so QA can assert coverage without live OpenAI calls. (`docs/stories/2.2.openai-readiness-probe.md:71-78`)

## Observations
- Research validation follow-up for Dev is now complete (trace/NFR artifacts and regression tests delivered); QA checklist update remains due 2025-10-02. (`docs/qa/assessments/2.2-researcher-validation-20250925.md:31-34`)
- Open question persists about a `--skip-live` or fixture mode for CI; note in story Dev Notes to confirm during implementation.
- Ensure documentation updates highlight token-budget messaging surfaced after backoff exhaustion so operators understand next steps.

## Decision
APPROVED (story ready for development once follow-ups are assigned to responsible teams).
