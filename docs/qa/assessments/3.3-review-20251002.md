# QA Review â€“ Story 3.3 (native-qdrant-retriever)

Date: 2025-10-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- `scripts/ask_qdrant.py` now delegates to `QdrantNeo4jRetriever`, eliminating duplicate Cypher/plumbing while keeping sanitized outputs stable.
- Unit tests cover retriever configuration, success, and failure paths; docs highlight the new dependency so operators know where to adjust collection/ID settings.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_ask_qdrant.py`
- Manual CLI run: `PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/ask_qdrant.py --question "What did Acme launch?" --top-k 3`
- Documentation: docs/architecture/overview.md (Minimal Path Workflow section)
- Story file: docs/stories/3.3.qdrant-native-retriever.md

## Issues & Actions
- Reliability remains flagged MONITOR until the integration smoke can execute with OpenAI credentials.
- No blocking defects observed; output schema and telemetry remain backward compatible.

## Recommendation
- Proceed to QA gate with PASS (monitor) status acknowledging the pending end-to-end smoke with live credentials.
