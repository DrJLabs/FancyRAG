**Date:** 2025-10-02T10:57:00-07:00  
**Validated By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** GO

## Summary
- Story delivers the semantic enrichment follow-up from Epic 3, aligning ingestion QA and retrieval docs with the new flag-based workflow.
- Tasks and acceptance criteria are fully checked, with supporting QA artifacts (risk, test design, trace, NFR, review, gate) published under `docs/qa/assessments/` and `docs/qa/gates/`.
- Dev Notes reference prior story insights (3.2–3.4) and architecture shards without introducing unsupported assumptions.

## Template Compliance
- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:** All required sections present; QA Results now reference published artifacts; no placeholder text remains.

## Critical Issues
- None

## Should Fix
- None

## Nice to Have
- Monitor telemetry once semantic mode is enabled in CI; consider future documentation of sample semantic outputs for operator training.

## Anti-Hallucination Review
- All cited sources verified (scripts, docs, QA artifacts) and accessible in repository.
- No unapproved dependencies or undocumented flags introduced.

## Assessment
- **Readiness Score:** 9
- **Confidence:** High

## Next Steps
- Update story status to Done.
