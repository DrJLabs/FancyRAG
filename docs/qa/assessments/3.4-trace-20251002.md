# Traceability Assessment – Story 3.4 (Documentation Lint Automation)

Date: 2025-10-02
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Summary
- All four acceptance criteria have explicit implementation artifacts and automated tests.
- Lint guard integrates with both CLI and minimal-path smoke, ensuring documentation drift is caught before merges.
- No uncovered scenarios identified; residual risk limited to documentation token drift monitored via CI.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| AC | Implementation Evidence | Test Coverage | Status |
|----|-------------------------|---------------|--------|
| 1  | `scripts/check_docs.py` enforces token presence for minimal-path commands, retriever, and lint guidance. | `tests/unit/scripts/test_check_docs.py::test_main_passes_when_all_tokens_present` / `test_main_fails_when_retriever_reference_missing` / `test_main_reports_missing_file` ensure positive/negative behaviour. | ✅ |
| 2  | Lint command invoked from CI entry points (`tests/integration/cli/test_check_docs_cli.py`) and minimal-path smoke (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`). | Integration test asserts CLI success; smoke workflow now runs the module inside `docker` environment using `.env`. | ✅ |
| 3  | Documentation updates in `docs/architecture/overview.md` (minimal-path steps + env loading) and `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. | Manual diff review + lint run `PYTHONPATH=src python -m scripts.check_docs --strict`; covered indirectly by unit/integration tests verifying required tokens. | ✅ |
| 4  | Automated reporting via sanitized JSON `artifacts/docs/check_docs.json` and smoke artifact `check_docs_smoke.json`. | Unit tests confirm JSON generation; integration CLI test reads JSON payload; smoke test prints status. | ✅ |

## Additional Notes
- Manual command: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m scripts.check_docs --strict` used to validate documentation in workspace.
- Ingestion/regression run: `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src python3 scripts/kg_build.py ...` followed by `scripts/export_to_qdrant.py` and `scripts/ask_qdrant.py` executed successfully with stack live; lint guard executed post-smoke.
- No TODOs pending for traceability.

## Conclusion
Story 3.4 traceability is COMPLETE. All acceptance criteria have direct implementation evidence and automated verification.
