# NFR Assessment: 2.4 – Docker Compose Stack for Neo4j + Qdrant

Date: 2025-09-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Compose stack sources secrets from `.env` with no hard-coded credentials; helper script avoids echoing sensitive values; smoke scripts emit redacted placeholder logs.
- Performance: PASS – Health checks gate container startup, helper script waits before running pipeline, and CI workflow focuses on config lint + smoke execution to avoid unnecessary load.
- Reliability: PASS (with monitor) – Unit tests assert presence of health checks and restart policy; integration test exercises failure messaging; smoke test now runs full helper sequence (skips only when Docker CLI unavailable). Monitor when Story 2.5 replaces stubs to ensure retries remain robust.
- Maintainability: PASS – Documentation covers lifecycle commands and automation helpers; production-parity checklist tracks future enhancements (digest pinning, CI secrets guidance).

## Quick Wins
- Once Story 2.5 delivers full ingestion scripts, extend smoke assertions to verify grounded answers instead of stub output.

## Recommendations
- Schedule quarterly review of compose image tags to maintain parity with managed stack.
