# NFR Assessment: 2.5 – Minimal Path Script Automation

Date: 2025-09-30
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Scripts reuse `cli.sanitizer.scrub_object`, redact secrets in JSON logs, and avoid echoing credentials. Unit tests execute without exposing API keys.
- Performance: PASS – Retried operations cap at `OPENAI_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; chunking CLI flags default to lightweight batches suitable for local stacks; vector index creation short-circuits when already present.
- Reliability: PASS (monitor) – Unit coverage asserts retry ceilings and idempotency; integration smoke remains pending infrastructure credentials so monitor once Docker/OpenAI pipeline runs end-to-end.
- Maintainability: PASS – Documentation updated with explicit CLI usage, sample content, and log expectations; structured logging plus shared client keep future telemetry consistent.

## Quick Wins
- Parameterize integration smoke environment in CI once OpenAI non-production keys are available.

## Recommendations
- Capture JSON log fixtures in `tests/fixtures/minimal_path/` for reuse by Qdrant export validation to tighten regression detection.
