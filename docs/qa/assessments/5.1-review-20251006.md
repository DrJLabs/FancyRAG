# QA Review: Story 5.1 (Pipeline Orchestrator Decomposition)

Date: 2025-10-06
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
- Reviewed helper decomposition across `src/fancyrag/kg/phases.py` and the refactored coordinator in `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py`.
- Audited companion docs (`docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md`) plus existing risk, test design, trace, and NFR assessments dated 2025-10-06.
- Validated unit coverage for helper phases and pipeline orchestration.

## Key Findings
- ✅ Helper-focused unit suites pass (11 targeted tests) covering settings resolution, environment guard behaviour, ingestion flows, and QA rollback.
- ✅ Trace (`docs/qa/assessments/5.1-trace-20251006.md`) now shows full coverage across all ACs.
- ✅ NFR assessment upgraded to PASS across the core four with maintainability guardrails in place.

## Tests Reviewed
- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_phases.py tests/unit/docs/architecture/test_helper_references.py -q`

## Gate Decision
- **PASS** — Helper decomposition, documentation, and guard coverage satisfy AC1–AC4 with no outstanding risks.

## Follow-ups
1. Keep the helper guard and docs lint in the standard CI suite to catch regressions.
2. Capture and archive the next minimal-path smoke run evidence for end-to-end assurance.
