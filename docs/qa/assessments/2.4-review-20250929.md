# QA Review: Story 2.4 – Docker Compose Stack for Neo4j + Qdrant

Date: 2025-09-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
- Assets: `docker-compose.neo4j-qdrant.yml`, `.env.example`, `scripts/check_local_stack.sh`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-production-parity-checklist.md`
- Automation: `tests/unit/compose/test_compose_file.py`, `tests/integration/local_stack/test_check_local_stack.py`, `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`, `.github/workflows/local-stack-smoke.yml`, `pytest.ini`

## Summary Assessment
- **Alignment:** All ACs satisfied – compose stack defined, documentation updated, automation in place, and smoke workflow executes (or skips only when Docker unavailable).
- **Code Quality:** Compose file, helper script, and stub pipelines follow coding standards; future Story 2.5 will extend stub scripts with real ingestion logic.
- **Testing:** Unit coverage verifies images, env wiring, health checks, and restart policies; integration coverage exercises helper error messaging and smoke workflow; CI workflow enforces config lint and smoke execution.
- **Documentation:** Runbook, `.env` template, and production-parity checklist provide operators with clear guidance and follow-up items.

## Findings
- Track action items in production-parity checklist (digest pinning, APOC override parity, CI secrets guidance) as enhancements outside Story 2.4 scope.
- Update smoke assertions after Story 2.5 replaces stub scripts to validate real pipeline output.

## Recommendation
- **Gate Ready:** QA gate can move to PASS; monitor checklist items in subsequent workstreams.
