# Risk Profile: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary
- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Story Risk Score: 94/100

Override guard now blocks accidental progression when the prior story is incomplete, records acknowledgements, and injects traceable notes. Residual exposure is limited to configuration drift (missing CLI invocation) and manual misuse of the `reason` field. Sources: src/cli/stories.py, tests/unit/cli/test_stories.py, tests/integration/cli/test_story_override_cli.py, .bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md, docs/bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md.

## Risk Distribution
### By Category
- Technical: 2 risks (Low)
- Operational: 1 risk (Low)

### By Component
- CLI guard (`cli.stories`): 2 risks
- Documentation workflow (override log + guidance): 1 risk

## Risk Matrix
| Risk ID  | Description                                                                 | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-401 | Automation forgets to call the guard module, reintroducing silent bypasses   | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-402 | Override note injection corrupts story file structure during repeated runs  | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-401  | Override log (`docs/bmad/story-overrides.md`) lacks stewardship and gets stale/noisy | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Detailed Risk Register
| Risk ID  | Category   | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|----------------|
| TECH-401 | Technical  | BMAD automation or human operators may skip running `python -m cli.stories`, bypassing the guard. | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Updated `.bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md` and AGENTS.md to mandate the command; integration test enforces CLI behaviour. | Process discipline still required; monitor story drafts for missing override notes. |
| TECH-402 | Technical  | Multiple overrides of the same story could duplicate or misplace the injected Dev Notes block. | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Unit tests verify note insertion; `cli.stories` reuses recognised anchor; override note clearly delimited. | Manual edits could break anchor; review Dev Notes before publishing. |
| OPS-401 | Operational | Override log may accumulate noise or sensitive reasoning if not curated. | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Log path documented; CLI accepts reason text and actor, enabling reviews; PO/QA attention required during retros. | Require periodic grooming; align with sprint review checklist. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy
- Sustain unit guard coverage (`tests/unit/cli/test_stories.py`) in CI smoke suite to catch regression of block/override behaviour.
- Keep integration checks (`tests/integration/cli/test_story_override_cli.py`) to validate logging and note injection in a repo-like environment.
- Add process audit ensuring story drafts created with override contain the injected note; align with Scrum Master checklist.

## Monitoring Requirements
- If automation triggers story creation, ensure pipeline logs the CLI invocation.
- Track size and content of `docs/bmad/story-overrides.md`; raise when reasons are blank or outdated.
