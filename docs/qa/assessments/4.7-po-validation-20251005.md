Status: Approved – Implementation Verified

## Scope Reviewed

## Alignment Check

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story statement & ACs reflect epic goal | ✅ | AC1–AC5 map directly to schema extraction, env centralisation, testing, and documentation updates outlined in Epic 4. |
| Tasks/Subtasks actionable & mapped to ACs | ✅ | Task list highlights schema module creation, env helper migration, tests, and doc refresh with clear source references. |
| Dev Notes completeness & references | ✅ | Dev notes capture dependencies from Story 4.6, environment handling constraints, and future coverage expectations. |
| QA coverage in place | ✅ | Risk/test/NFR assessments document unit + integration coverage and note remaining schema override regression for Story 4.8. |
| Dependencies & sequencing acknowledged | ✅ | Story references CLI/pipeline consumers, documentation shards, and future Story 4.8 follow-up for override coverage. |

## Observations & Follow-Ups
1. **Testing checklist updated:** Minimal-path smoke checkbox now marked complete, matching test evidence in QA artifacts.
2. **Schema override regression:** Track follow-up in Story 4.8 to exercise custom schema path handling as noted in QA recommendations.
3. **Regression cadence:** Maintain weekly execution of `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py` with `LOCAL_STACK_SKIP_DOCKER_CHECK=1` to guard environment bootstrap changes.

## Post-Implementation Verification
- Reviewed QA evidence and gate: docs/qa/gates/4.7-schema-and-env.yml reflects PASS with low residual risk.
- Confirmed unit suites and integration smoke executed on 2025-10-05 via story QA Results and assessment documents.
- Re-checked architecture shards to ensure schema/env modules now appear under delivered items.

## Decision
- **Approved – Implementation Verified.** Deliverables satisfy acceptance criteria with aligned documentation and QA coverage. Safe to move Story 4.7 to Done.

## Notes for Dev & QA Teams
- Coordinate with Story 4.8 to add schema override regression coverage.
- Keep integration smoke in the standard regression rotation to detect environment drift early.
