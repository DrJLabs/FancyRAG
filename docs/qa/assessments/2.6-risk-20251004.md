# Risk Profile: Story 2.6

Date: 2025-10-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 1
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 95/100

## Medium-Risk Items Requiring Monitoring

### TECH-001: Base URL path drift across adapters
- **Score:** 4 (Medium) — Probability: Medium · Impact: Medium
- **Why it matters:** Divergent adapter paths or stale probes could silently break override integrations, leading to failed gateway routing.
- **Mitigation:** Run diagnostics probe smoke with overrides in CI, compare captured base URL telemetry, and alert when adapters diverge. Maintain FancyRAG pipeline regression with override enabled.
- **Testing focus:** Keep diagnostics probe smoke/regression tests as part of release gating.

## Risk Distribution

- **Security:** 0 risks
- **Technical:** 1 risk (0 high)
- **Operational/Performance/Data/Business:** 0 risks recorded

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category  | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| TECH-001 | Technical | Base URL paths diverge across adapters, causing 404/460 responses and silent retries. | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Keep diagnostics probe smoke asserting override propagation; surface health-check telemetry for base URL mismatches. | Low once monitored |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

1. **Priority – Functional smoke**
   - Run diagnostics probe and FancyRAG pipeline end-to-end against mocked gateway to detect path drift.

## Monitoring Recommendations

- Track override usage with structured metrics (`openai.client.base_url_override`).
- Alert when diagnostics probe reports mismatched or missing base URL overrides.
- Monitor FancyRAG pipeline warnings for base URL mismatches after dependency updates.

## Risk Acceptance Notes

- Override support remains optional; shipping requires successful diagnostics smoke run for gateway scenario.
