## Alignment Check

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story statement & ACs reflect epic goal | ✅ | ACs cover index automation, pipeline orchestration, documentation, and automation upgrades required for Epic 2 minimal path readiness. |
| Tasks/Subtasks actionable & mapped to ACs | ✅ | Task list names the scripts, documentation targets, and testing additions with references to architecture shards for each deliverable. |
| Dev Notes completeness & references | ✅ | Dev notes summarise dependencies on Stories 2.3 and 2.4, outline data model expectations, and reinforce secrets/logging constraints. |
| QA coverage in place | ✅ | Risk profile prioritises vector index validation and retries; test design supplies 12 scenarios spanning unit, integration, and E2E coverage. |
| Dependencies & overrides acknowledged | ✅ (watch) | Override history recorded; Story 2.4 outputs and upcoming Story 2.6 export linkage are called out so sequencing is visible for developers. |

## Observations & Follow-Ups
1. **Vector index validation:** Implementation now asserts Neo4j vector index metadata during smoke; continue tracking TECH-250 for future automation hardening.
2. **Retry/backoff telemetry:** Smoke run exercised OpenAI retries; submit metrics snapshot to QA before enabling CI auto-runs.
3. **Runbook sync:** Documentation updated with compose preflight/teardown; schedule follow-up to add screenshots/log excerpts once Story 2.6 fixtures are finalized.

## Post-Implementation Verification
- Confirmed unit suites (`pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_create_vector_index.py -q` and `pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py -q`) and integration smoke (`pytest tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py -k minimal -vv`) completed on 2025-09-30.
- Reviewed updated documentation in `docs/stories/2.5.minimal-path-scripts.md` and architecture overview; cross-checked instructions against executed compose workflow.
- Validated sanitized log output at `artifacts/local_stack/kg_build.json` and ensured sensitive fields remain redacted.

## Decision
- **Approved – Implementation Verified.** Story deliverables satisfy acceptance criteria, and automated smoke confirms minimal-path workflow readiness.

## Notes for Dev Agent
- Implement scripts with shared configuration helpers and emit structured logs per coding standards.
- Prioritise unit tests for CLI defaults and retry handling before wiring integration smoke updates.
- Coordinate with QA on log fixture capture so redaction checks align with Story 2.3 sanitisation rules.
