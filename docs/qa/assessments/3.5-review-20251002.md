# QA Review – Story 3.5 (Semantic Enrichment Pipeline & Retrieval Surfacing)

Date: 2025-10-02
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)

## Summary
- Optional semantic enrichment path added to ingestion with provenance tagging, rollback, and QA thresholds.
- Retrieval CLI can now surface semantic nodes/relationships when requested, keeping default output unchanged.
- Architecture overview documents new flag, thresholds, and telemetry so operators can enable enrichment safely.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Code: `scripts/kg_build.py`, `scripts/ask_qdrant.py`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`, story testing section.
- Tests: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`, `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_ask_qdrant.py`, `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m scripts.check_docs --strict`.
- QA Artifacts: `docs/qa/assessments/3.5-risk-20251002.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/3.5-test-design-20251002.md`.

## Findings
- Semantic enrichment correctly tagged with `semantic_source` and provenance; QA metrics capture counts/failures. ✅
- Retrieval CLI enrichment is opt-in and sanitized; unit test proves payload integration. ✅
- Documentation explains workflow/flags; lint guard remains green. ✅
- Residual risk limited to semantic runtime/resource usage—already covered in NFR recommendations. ⚠️ Monitor

## Recommendation
- PASS with monitoring of semantic runtime when enabling feature on large corpora.

## Follow-Ups
- Monitor telemetry for extraction latency/token spikes once semantic mode enabled in CI or production environments.
