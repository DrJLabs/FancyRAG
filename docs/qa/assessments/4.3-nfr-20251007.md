# NFR Assessment: 4.3

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS – Module extraction is internal-only; no auth, data-handling, or secret-management code paths changed.
- Performance: PASS – Caching semantics and chunk regeneration algorithms remain identical for supported inputs; cache blueprint reuse still holds.
- Reliability: PASS – Sequence inputs are normalized before delegating to `FixedSizeSplitter`, and dedicated unit coverage verifies the restored path.
- Maintainability: PASS – Guard added to adapt to upstream validation changes and tests enforce the behaviour; documentation remains aligned.

## Critical Issues

- None.

## Quick Wins

1. Schedule a periodic integration smoke run (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`) after pipeline-affecting changes to confirm cache interactions under real graph drivers.
