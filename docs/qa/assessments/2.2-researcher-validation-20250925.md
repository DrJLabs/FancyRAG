# Research Validation: Story 2.2 OpenAI Readiness Probe

Date: 2025-09-25

## 🔬 Research & Validation Log (2025-09-25)
- **Researcher:** Dr. Evelyn Reed
- **Active Mode:** solo
- **Primary Artifact:** docs/stories/2.2.openai-readiness-probe.md
- **Summary:** Story 2.2 establishes a readiness probe for OpenAI integrations, and now explicitly mandates exponential backoff for 429/`RateLimitError` responses, Prometheus histogram buckets between 100 ms–5 s, and reuse of diagnostics redaction helpers so probe telemetry remains production-safe. Remaining validation tracks focus on verifying implementation and QA coverage.

### Findings & Actions
| Priority | Area | Recommended Change | Owner / Reviewer | Confidence | Mode | Controls | Evidence Location | Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | Rate-limit resilience | Expand AC3/Tasks to require handling 429/`RateLimitError` responses with exponential backoff and token-budget messaging in both CLI output and artifacts, ensuring failures stay actionable without spamming the API. | Dev / QA | High | solo | CIS Controls 16.12 | Story §Acceptance Criteria 3 | citeturn2search0 |
| Medium | Prometheus histogram buckets | Document and test a default histogram bucket layout aligned with latency SLOs (e.g., 100 ms–5 s) so exported metrics yield accurate p95/p99 quantiles across instances. Add a task to assert bucket definitions in tests. | Dev / SRE | Medium | solo | ISO 25010 Performance Efficiency | Story §Tasks / Subtasks | citeturn1search1 |
| Medium | Log and artifact redaction | Require reusable redaction helpers (shared with diagnostics) to scrub API keys, bearer tokens, and prompts in probe logs/JSON artifacts. Add negative tests that fail if sensitive strings appear. | Dev / QA | Medium | solo | OWASP ASVS 8.10 | Story §Dev Notes → Secrets Handling | citeturn0search3 |

### Tooling Guidance
- Reuse the existing `OpenAIMetrics` registry; expose bucket configuration via settings to keep future SLO adjustments code-free.
- Mirror diagnostics sanitization helpers for JSON artifacts and structured logs; centralize in `src/cli/telemetry.py` to avoid drift.
- Add pytest fixtures stubbing OpenAI responses for 200, 429, and invalid-dimension cases.

### Risk & Compliance Notes
- **Residual Risks:** Without explicit backoff, the probe can lock out production keys under surge testing. Missing histogram guidance risks misleading SLO dashboards.
- **Compliance / Control Mapping:** Aligns with CIS Controls 16 (Application Software Security) and OWASP ASVS logging requirements for secret redaction.
- **Monitoring / Observability:** Ensure the metrics file includes `prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens` counters for reconciliation against billing dashboards.
- **Rollback / Contingency:** If live calls fail, allow a `--skip-live` or recorded-fixture mode so CI stays green while investigating outages.

### Follow-Up Tasks
- [x] Update Story 2.2 acceptance criteria and tasks per findings. Owner: Scrum Master; Due: 2025-09-26 (confirmed 2025-09-25).
- [x] Implement regression tests for histogram bucket definitions and log redaction. Owner: Dev; Due: 2025-09-30 (delivered 2025-09-25 via new unit/integration pytest coverage).
- [ ] Add QA checklist items verifying 429 handling and sanitized outputs. Owner: QA; Due: 2025-10-02 (owner confirmed 2025-09-25).
