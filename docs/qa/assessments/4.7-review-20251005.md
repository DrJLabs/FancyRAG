# QA Review: Story 4.7 (Schema and Environment Utilities)

Date: 2025-10-05
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
- Reviewed schema/config extraction (`src/fancyrag/config/schema.py` + imports) and env bootstrap consolidation (`src/fancyrag/utils/env.py`).
- Verified downstream script/CLI adjustments and documentation updates across architecture shards.
- Confirmed risk, test design, traceability, and NFR assessments dated 2025-10-05.

## Key Findings
- ✅ Unit suites exercise schema path resolution, env bootstrap permutations, and CLI/pipeline wiring; integration smoke executed with `.env` credentials on 2025-10-05.
- ✅ Documentation shards (`docs/architecture/source-tree.md`, `docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md`, epic shard) now reference delivered modules.
- ⚠️ Story testing checklist still shows the minimal-path smoke unchecked despite recorded execution—dev should tick the checkbox for accuracy.

## Tests Reviewed
- `PYTHONPATH=src:. pytest tests/unit/fancyrag/config/test_schema.py tests/unit/fancyrag/test_env_utils.py tests/unit/scripts/test_export_to_qdrant.py tests/unit/scripts/test_create_vector_index.py tests/unit/scripts/test_ask_qdrant.py tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_pipeline.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src:. pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src:. LOCAL_STACK_SKIP_DOCKER_CHECK=1 pytest tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py -rs`

## Gate Decision
- **PASS** — Code, tests, and documentation satisfy AC1–AC5 with low residual risk.
- Recommendation: Update story testing checklist to mark the executed integration smoke before shipping to Done.

## Follow-ups
1. Add schema override regression in Story 4.8 to validate custom path handling.
2. Keep minimal-path smoke in weekly rotation (`LOCAL_STACK_SKIP_DOCKER_CHECK=1`).
