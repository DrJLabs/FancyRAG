# NFR Assessment: 2.3

Date: 2025-09-28
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Shared client routes all logging through existing redaction helpers; unit tests (`tests/unit/cli/test_openai_client.py::test_embedding_dimension_mismatch_raises`, `tests/unit/cli/test_openai_probe.py::test_openai_probe_rate_limit_failure`) confirm errors surface without leaking secrets. `.env.example` keeps credentials out of git, and fallback toggles prevent accidental exposure of unsupported models.
- Performance: PASS – Configurable `OPENAI_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and `OPENAI_BACKOFF_SECONDS` allow operators to tune retry budgets; rate-limit handling honours `Retry-After` headers (validated in `tests/unit/cli/test_openai_client.py::test_retry_after_header_controls_backoff`). Prometheus metrics remain unchanged, protecting dashboard SLOs.
- Reliability: PASS – Shared client centralises retries, dimension validation, and telemetry. Readiness probe integration tests (`tests/integration/cli/test_openai_probe_cli.py`) guarantee artefact parity, and failure modes record remediation guidance.
- Maintainability: PASS – Wrapper isolates OpenAI interactions, reducing duplication. Documentation updates (`docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`) describe new knobs, and tests demonstrate clear seams for future async work.

## Critical Issues
- None identified; residual work (async decision, metrics fixture automation) tracked as follow-up tasks rather than blockers.

## Quick Wins
- Automate golden metrics diff (already noted in researcher findings) to catch schema drift when extending the shared client to ingest/export scripts.

## Recommendations
- Coordinate with observability to add alerting on repeated fallback usage now that counters are centralised.
