# Risk Profile: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary
- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 92/100

Implementation shipped with deterministic diagnostics, redaction, and automated coverage. Residual exposure is now limited to dependency rename drift and operator bypasses.

## Risk Distribution
### By Category
- Technical: 2 risks (High: 0)
- Security: 1 risk (High: 0)
- Operational: 1 risk (High: 0)

### By Component
- CLI diagnostics command: 2 risks
- Reporting pipeline (`artifacts/environment/versions.json`): 1 risk
- Documentation / bootstrap handoff: 1 risk

## Risk Matrix
| Risk ID  | Description                                                                                       | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-301 | Import coverage falls behind new dependency names/extras, causing false pass                       | Low (1)     | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| SEC-301  | Future logging change bypasses redaction and leaks secrets in report output                        | Low (1)     | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| OPS-301  | Diagnostics fails to create artifact directory or reports become tracked in git                    | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-302 | Hash provenance mismatches because `requirements.lock` removed or regenerated unexpectedly         | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Detailed Risk Register
| Risk ID  | Category   | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|----------------|
| TECH-301 | Technical  | Module list may miss renamed packages or additional extras, letting diagnostics exit 0 despite missing runtime deps. | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Maintain explicit mapping and unit tests that fail on `ModuleNotFoundError`; integration tests simulate stub removals. | Package rename upstream; requires periodic review when extras change. |
| SEC-301  | Security   | If sanitiser misses new secret formats, diagnostics output could leak credentials. | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Redaction helper masks known secret patterns; unit/integration tests assert secrets absent from stdout/stderr/report. | New secret prefixes may appear; monitor OpenAI/Neo4j/Qdrant tooling for updates. |
| OPS-301 | Operational | `artifacts/` directory missing or becomes tracked, creating CI noise and merge conflicts. | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | CLI ensures directory creation; `.gitignore` entry enforced; integration test checks git status clean after run. | Manual edits to `.gitignore` could reintroduce risk. |
| TECH-302 | Technical  | Lockfile checksum or git metadata unavailable, reducing audit value of report. | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Diagnostics warns on missing `requirements.lock`; unit tests assert schema keys, integration tests verify 64-char SHA. | Teams might intentionally rotate lockfile without regenerating snapshots. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy
- **Priority 1 (sustain):** Keep unit tests for missing dependency handling and redaction in CI smoke suite (`1.3-UNI-001`..`003`), ensuring quick detection of regressions.
- **Priority 1 (sustain):** Retain integration scenario forcing dependency failure and redaction verification to cover realistic operator flows (`1.3-INT-007`, `1.3-INT-008`).
- **Priority 2:** Periodically rerun git hygiene test to confirm artifacts stay untracked and directories are created automatically (`1.3-INT-009`).
- **Priority 2:** Monitor hash schema snapshot tests to detect lockfile drift (`1.3-UNI-004`, `1.3-INT-005`).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria
- Must fix before release: None outstanding (all residual risks â‰¤ Low with mitigations in place).
- Deploy with monitoring: OPS-301, TECH-302.
- Accepted: None.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Schedule nightly diagnostics run in CI to confirm module list and redaction still pass; alert on schema changes.
- Track lockfile hash mismatches and `.gitignore` edits in code review templates.

## Gate Snippet
```yaml
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 4
  highest: TECH-301
  recommendations:
    sustain:
      - Review diagnostics module mapping whenever dependencies upgrade.
      - Keep redaction regression tests in mandatory CI stage.
    monitor:
      - Watch for `.gitignore` modifications that expose artifacts/`.
