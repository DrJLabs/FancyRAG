# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 3.5 (Semantic Enrichment Pipeline & Retrieval Surfacing)

Date: 2025-10-02
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Security
- **Status:** PASS
- Semantic enrichment reuses existing sanitization; provenance metadata carries repo-relative paths and git commits only.
- `_fetch_semantic_context` scrubs properties before returning them to CLI consumers.
- No new secrets or environment variables introduced.

## Performance
- **Status:** PASS (Monitor)
- Semantic extractor guarded by `--enable-semantic`; default workflow unaffected.
- Concurrency capped via `--semantic-max-concurrency` (default 5) with CLI override.
- QA metrics expose semantic runtime/failure counts, enabling regression tracking.

## Reliability
- **Status:** PASS
- Failures trigger `_rollback_ingest`, preventing partial semantic writes.
- QA thresholds (`--qa-max-semantic-failures`, `--qa-max-semantic-orphans`) halt runs when anomalies detected.
- Tests cover success path and ensure semantic context is optional during retrieval.

## Maintainability
- **Status:** PASS
- Provenance tagging consolidated in `_annotate_semantic_graph`; environment knobs documented in architecture overview.
- Story Dev Notes enumerate relevant sources; risk/test design artifacts created.
- Unit suites updated to prevent regressions in both ingestion and retrieval CLI.

## Observability
- **Status:** PASS
- Run log `semantic` block records chunk counts/failures/nodes/relationships.
- QA report includes semantic metrics and anomalies, keeping telemetry centralized.
- Retrieval CLI outputs optional semantic block on demand for debugging.

## Recommendations
- Monitor extraction runtime/token usage when semantic mode enabled on large corpora and adjust concurrency accordingly.
- Consider future integration tests to exercise semantic path against compose smoke once corpora available.

## Conclusion
Story 3.5 meets non-functional requirements with minor monitoring actions noted.
