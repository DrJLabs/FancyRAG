# PO Validation: Story 4.8 – Tests and Smoke Coverage

Date: 2025-10-05
Product Owner: Sarah (PO)
Status: Approved – Implementation Verified

## Scope Reviewed
- docs/stories/4.8.tests-and-smoke.md (Updated story with QA and PO results)
- docs/bmad/focused-epics/kg-build-refactor/epic.md – Epic alignment for testing coverage
- docs/qa/gates/4.8-tests-and-smoke.yml – Final gate decision and evidence
- docs/qa/assessments/4.8-trace-20251005.md – Acceptance criteria traceability
- docs/qa/assessments/4.8-nfr-20251005.md – Non-functional validation summary
- docs/stories/4.7.schema-and-env.md – Dependency follow-through from schema/env work

## Alignment Check

| Area | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story statement & ACs reflect epic goal | ✅ | AC1–AC4 cover unit breadth, integration smoke parity, schema/env regressions, and documentation evidence called out in Epic 4. |
| Tasks/Subtasks actionable & mapped to ACs | ✅ | Checklist now marked complete with direct AC references and source citations. |
| Dev Notes completeness & references | ✅ | Notes capture prior story dependencies, data model expectations, and CLI semantics needed for verification. |
| QA coverage in place | ✅ | Trace + NFR assessments show full AC coverage and green NFR statuses; gate documents passing unit + integration runs. |
| Dependencies & sequencing acknowledged | ✅ | References to Story 4.7 follow-up and integration smoke rotation preserved in QA recommendations.

## Observations & Follow-Ups
1. Documentation now includes Product Owner validation pointer, keeping audit trail consistent with earlier stories.
2. Integration smoke evidence captured with environment overrides; continue weekly cadence to guard credential drift.
3. No additional backlog items required; residual recommendations are operational (smoke scheduling, credential monitoring).

## Post-Implementation Verification
- Confirmed QA gate is PASS with zero open issues and quality score 100.
- Verified unit suite (214 tests) and integration smoke command outputs recorded in story QA Results.
- Spot-checked epic summary to ensure Story 4.8 completion aligns with remaining Epic 4 scope.

## Decision
- **Approved – Implementation Verified.** Acceptance criteria satisfied with supporting QA artifacts; story ready to remain in Done status.

## Notes for Dev & QA Teams
- Maintain minimal-path smoke in regression rotation per QA recommendation.
- Monitor OPENAI credential availability in CI to avoid future smoke interruptions.
