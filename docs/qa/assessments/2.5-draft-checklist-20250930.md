# Story Draft Checklist â€“ Story 2.5: Minimal Path Script Automation

Date: 2025-09-30
Reviewer: Codex (Story Analyst)

## Summary
Story 2.5 is ready for implementation. It clearly defines the automation goals for the minimal path scripts, enumerates the required files and integrations, and provides anchored references plus testing guidance. Dependencies on Stories 2.3 and 2.4 are explicitly captured in the dev notes, ensuring continuity for the local stack workflow.

## Checklist Results
| Category                             | Status | Notes |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   | Story goal, epic alignment, and dependencies (Stories 2.3 & 2.4) are explicit, framing value for operators running the minimal path. |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   | Tasks call out the scripts to replace, configuration helpers, retry expectations, and Neo4j/OpenAI integration boundaries. |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   | Anchored references point to relevant epic, architecture, and coding standard sections with context for each requirement. |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   | Core requirements, assumptions, and terminology (vector index, SimpleKGPipeline) are explained within the story and dev notes. |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   | Testing section specifies unit and integration targets, fixtures, and telemetry expectations aligned with coding standards. |

**Final Assessment:** READY (Clarity 9/10)

## Follow-ups
- No blocking issues identified. Monitor documentation updates in AC3 once implementation refines runbooks.
