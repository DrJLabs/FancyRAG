# QA Review – Story 3.4 (Documentation Lint Automation)

Date: 2025-10-02
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)

## Summary
- Documentation lint guard implemented with structured logging and JSON artifact output.
- `.env` auto-loading ensures stack scripts pick up OpenAI credentials without manual export, resolving recurring smoke failures.
- Minimal-path smoke sequence executed against live Docker stack; lint guard invoked post-retrieval.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Code: `scripts/check_docs.py`, `src/fancyrag/utils/env.py`, documentation shards, smoke workflow update.
- Tests: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_check_docs.py`, `tests/integration/cli/test_check_docs_cli.py`, `tests/unit/fancyrag/test_env_utils.py`.
- Smoke run: `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src python3 scripts/create_vector_index.py`, `scripts/kg_build.py`, `scripts/export_to_qdrant.py`, `scripts/ask_qdrant.py` (stack left running for follow-up QA), `python -m scripts.check_docs`.

## Findings
- Lint guard fails fast when tokens missing; integration test validates CLI exit path. ✅
- `.env` discovery walks upward; unit tests confirm override precedence. ✅
- Smoke retrieval succeeded (no matches expected due to dataset but pipeline completed), ensuring lint guard runs in real workflow. ✅
- Warnings about `uid` property surfaced (legacy in QA metrics) but non-blocking; note for future backlog. ⚠️ Monitor

## Recommendation
- PASS with monitor: keep an eye on Neo4j warning about `uid` property; consider cleanup in subsequent story.

## Follow-Ups
- Track `uid` warning in backlog (Story 3.x maintenance) to ensure ingestion QA queries align with current schema.
