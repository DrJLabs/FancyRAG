# Story 4.4 Product Owner Validation – QA Evaluator Module

**Date:** 2025-10-04T20:45:00-04:00  
**Validated By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** GO

## Executive Summary
- Project Type: Brownfield backend refactor (no UI surface). 
- Overall readiness: 96% — all mandatory sections satisfied with clear implementation context. 
- Critical blocking issues: 0. 
- Sections skipped: UI/UX checklist items per backend scope.

## Project-Specific Analysis (Brownfield)
- **Integration Risk:** Low — evaluator extraction preserves existing pipeline contracts and includes rollback reinforcement via `IngestionQaEvaluator` failure path (src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py:1503). 
- **Existing System Impact:** Minimal; story anchors tasks to proven modules and documents import boundaries in `docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md` and `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. 
- **Rollback Readiness:** High — pipeline still invokes `_rollback_ingest` on QA fail, and smoke test confirms behaviour (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`). 
- **User Disruption Potential:** None; change is internal to ingestion tooling with no user-facing surface.

## Template Compliance
- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:** Story follows template structure, references sharded PRD/architecture sections, and enumerates testing plus QA artifacts. No placeholders remain.

## Checklist Highlights
- Project setup, dev environment, and dependency notes reference existing FancyRAG stack; no new scaffolding required. 
- Infrastructure/deployment requirements covered through reuse of Neo4j/Qdrant stack and smoke automation. 
- External dependencies (OpenAI, Neo4j, Qdrant) acknowledged with `.env` loading behaviour in Testing section. 
- User vs agent responsibilities clearly separated: manual actions limited to QA/PO gates, while development tasks are actionable for automation agents. 
- Functional/technical dependencies sequence evaluator extraction before pipeline refactor tasks, aligning with Story 4.3 learnings. 
- Risk management aligns with QA risk profile (TECH-001, DATA-001, OPS-001) and corresponding mitigations. 
- MVP scope: addresses Epic 4 refactor guardrails without scope creep. 
- Documentation & handoff: architecture shards and QA gate updated; story references new risk/test design assets.

## Risk Assessment
- Mirrors QA risk profile: TECH-001 (QA gating drift, high), DATA-001 (report contract drift, medium), OPS-001 (`.env` propagation, low). Mitigations in place via unit/integration/smoke coverage and shared path helpers. No schedule impact expected.

## MVP Completeness
- All ACs trace to epic deliverables; no extraneous features introduced. Edge cases handled through semantic summary coverage and rollback paths.

## Implementation Readiness
- Developer clarity score: 9/10 (tasks, file locations, and testing commands explicit). 
- Ambiguous requirements: 0. 
- Integration points with pipeline/CLI spelled out; semantic optionality documented in Dev Notes.

## Recommendations
- **Must Fix Before Development:** None outstanding. 
- **Should Fix:** During implementation, ensure downstream tooling consuming QA reports is notified about the helper move (communication item only). 
- **Consider:** Future story 4.5 can build atop evaluator by adding dedicated report module; no action required now. 
- **Post-MVP:** Monitor for report schema expansion once `qa/report.py` arrives.

## Integration Confidence (Brownfield)
- Confidence preserving existing functionality: High — automated coverage plus smoke. 
- Rollback completeness: Confirmed via pipeline QA failure path and doc references. 
- Monitoring coverage: existing ingestion logs continue to capture QA metrics; no gaps detected. 
- Support readiness: Documentation updates in architecture shards keep operations informed.

## Anti-Hallucination Review
- All references point to repository documents or source files (`docs/prd`, `docs/architecture`, `src/fancyrag`). No external or unverified dependencies introduced.

## Assessment
- **Readiness Score:** 9
- **Confidence:** High

## Next Steps
- Hand off to Dev agent for final diff polish/merge. 
- Notify QA that PO validation is complete so gate artefacts remain aligned with deployment.
