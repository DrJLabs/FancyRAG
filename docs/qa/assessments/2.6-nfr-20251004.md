# NFR Assessment: 2.6

Date: 2025-10-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS — HTTPS-only enforcement blocks plaintext overrides unless operators explicitly set the insecure flag.
- Performance: PASS — Override delegates to existing retry/backoff logic; no additional latency budget impact observed.
- Reliability: PASS — FancyRAG pipeline regression executes successfully with neo4j/pandas stubs, restoring confidence in override propagation.
- Maintainability: PASS — Configuration knob documented and unit-tested; telemetry masking keeps observability overhead low.

## Critical Issues

None — core four meet expectations after HTTPS enforcement and probe coverage updates.

## Quick Wins

- Introduce lightweight diagnostics probe smoke test that fails fast when override cannot connect (~1 hour).
