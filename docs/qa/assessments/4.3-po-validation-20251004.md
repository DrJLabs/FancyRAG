# Story 4.3 Product Owner Validation – Caching Splitter Module

**Date:** 2025-10-04T11:05:00-07:00  
**Validated By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** GO

## Summary
- Story aligns with Epic 4 objective to finish decomposing the KG build stack by relocating splitter logic into its own module while keeping CLI behaviour unchanged. 
- Acceptance criteria trace cleanly to the PRD, refactor addendum, and existing pipeline implementation; tasks outline migration steps, test updates, and documentation refreshes needed for parity. 
- Dev Notes cite Story 4.2 lessons plus architecture shards for data flow, import boundaries, and testing strategy, keeping the developer brief grounded in authoritative sources.

## Template Compliance
- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:** Required sections are present with actionable references; Testing and Dev Notes pull explicit file paths and commands, and QA Results correctly remain pending.

## Critical Issues
- None.

## Should Fix
- Emphasize in execution that `src/fancyrag/splitters/__init__.py` should expose the relocated splitter to avoid import churn; the File Locations note already mentions this, so reinforce it during kickoff.

## Nice to Have
- Consider capturing an additional unit test case ensuring `CachingFixedSizeSplitter.get_cached` returns `None` before the first run to guard regressions when new scopes are introduced.

## Anti-Hallucination Review
- Story sources resolve to in-repo documents (`docs/prd/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor/prd.md`, architecture shards, existing pipeline/tests); no external or unsupported dependencies detected.

## Assessment
- **Readiness Score:** 9
- **Confidence:** High

## Next Steps
- Hand off to Dev agent to begin extraction work, ensuring the package init file and test suite updates stay within scope. 
- Notify QA to prepare gating artifacts once development completes so the Ready → Done transition remains fast.
