# NFR Assessment: Story 4.5 (QA Report Module)

Date: 2025-10-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Scope: security, performance, reliability, maintainability

## Summary
- Overall Status: PASS (core four)
- Evidence Command: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/fancyrag/utils/test_paths.py tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py::test_run_with_external_qa_report_dir`
- Key Artefacts: `src/fancyrag/qa/report.py`, `tests/unit/fancyrag/qa/test_report.py`, `tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`

## Findings by Attribute

### Security — PASS
- Sanitisation step `_scrub_relative_paths` strips absolute filesystem references before rendering artefacts, preventing leakage of sensitive paths (`src/fancyrag/qa/report.py:73-101`).
- Regression test `test_run_with_external_qa_report_dir` confirms reports remain sanitized even when the QA directory is external to the repo.
- No new secrets or credentials introduced; existing CLI options unchanged.

### Performance — PASS
- Report generation performs bounded file I/O with minimal payloads; timestamp collision loop ensures O(n) retry bounded by collisions.
- Tests verified deterministic execution under typical workloads with no added latency-sensitive operations.

### Reliability — PASS
- Timestamp suffix fallback prevents artefact overwrites during rapid reruns (`src/fancyrag/qa/report.py:29-47`).
- Pipeline regression test validates artefact creation succeeds for both in-repo and external directories, demonstrating resilient path handling.

### Maintainability — PASS
- New autouse fixture resets `resolve_repo_root` cache between tests, keeping suites deterministic (`tests/unit/fancyrag/utils/test_paths.py:12-18`).
- Targeted unit and integration coverage document expected behaviours, easing future refactors.
- Documentation updates captured in story change log and supporting architecture shards.

## Recommendations
- Keep the targeted pytest command in CI to ensure cache resets and external-directory coverage remain enforced.
- Revisit performance only if future stories expand payload size significantly; current implementation is efficient.
