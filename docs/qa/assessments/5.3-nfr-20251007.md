# NFR Assessment: Story 5.3

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Security
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Stage failures now sanitize subprocess output before logging or persisting summaries (`src/fancyrag/cli/service_workflow.py:142-153,468-475`), and regression coverage (`tests/unit/fancyrag/cli/test_service_workflow.py::test_stage_failure_sanitizes_summary`) confirms secrets are redacted from both exception details and `service_run.json`.

## Performance
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Smoke-run telemetry captured on 2025-10-07 (artifacts/local_stack/service/20251007T124244/service_run.json) keeps bootstrap-to-teardown under 35 seconds, and the documentation now treats those timings as the baseline threshold for smoke presets. Future regressions surface via the persisted stage-duration metrics.

## Reliability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: `tests/unit/fancyrag/cli/test_service_workflow.py::test_service_rollback_invokes_cleanup` exercises the rollback path end to end, asserting Neo4j ingest rollback, Qdrant collection deletion, and teardown flag handling. The integration smoke continues to cover `make service-reset`, providing redundancy for Docker teardown.

## Maintainability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Orchestration lives in a dedicated module (`src/fancyrag/cli/service_workflow.py`) with focused unit coverage for stage sequencing, logging, and overrides (`tests/unit/fancyrag/cli/test_service_workflow.py::test_service_run_invokes_stages_in_order`, `::test_service_run_emits_stage_logs`, `::test_service_run_custom_dataset_path`) plus integration smoke exercising the entry point (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py::test_minimal_path_smoke`). Documentation lint keeps onboarding references in sync via `scripts/check_docs.py`.

## Action Items
- None â€” immediate security and reliability gaps closed by new regression coverage; continue to monitor smoke telemetry as datasets grow.
