# NFR Assessment: 2.2

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Shared sanitizer module redacts API keys, tokens, and prompt text across CLI output, metrics, and JSON artifacts; regression tests cover nested structures and negative cases (`tests/unit/cli/test_sanitizer.py`, `tests/unit/cli/test_openai_probe.py`).
- Performance: PASS – Prometheus latency buckets tightened to 100 ms–5 s, telemetry counters verified in unit/integration suites, and guidance added to `docs/architecture/overview.md` for dashboard alignment.
- Reliability: PASS – Exponential backoff with capped retries, `--skip-live` fixture mode, and failure artifacts containing remediation instructions ensure probe resilience during outages.
- Maintainability: PASS – Probe implementation reuses existing settings/telemetry helpers, provides configurable retry parameters, and isolates sanitization/metrics logic for future probes.

## Critical Issues
- None identified.

## Quick Wins
- Automate lint to detect documentation drift between probe instructions and CLI flags (`--skip-live`, `--max-attempts`).

## Recommendations
- Integrate probe execution into nightly smoke suite to produce real metrics samples for Grafana dashboards.
