# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 3.1 (adaptive-chunking)

Date: 2025-10-01
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Security
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Scripts continue to load credentials from environment variables and reuse existing sanitization helpers. New metadata fields avoid exposing raw secrets; checksum generation is deterministic and does not log source contents.

## Performance
- Status: MONITOR
- Rationale: Directory ingestion introduces potentially large corpora. Dry-run estimation is not yet implemented, but batching and chunk sizes remain configurable. Recommend tracking ingestion duration and token metrics via emitted logs (`artifacts/local_stack/kg_build.json`).

## Reliability
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Unit coverage exercises directory ingestion and metadata propagation, and default single-file flow remains intact. Compose smoke should be rerun post-merge to confirm end-to-end behaviour with Docker + OpenAI credentials.

## Maintainability
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: CLI options are documented (`README.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`), tests cover new branches, and metadata persisted to Neo4j/Qdrant simplifies debugging/regression triage.

## Recommendations
- Add optional `--dry-run`/stats mode in future story to estimate token cost before full ingestion (addresses Performance monitor flag).
- Schedule compose smoke execution once managed secrets available to confirm reliability in Docker context.
