# NFR Assessment: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
Evaluate non-functional aspects of the story override guard, including logging hygiene, maintainability, and compatibility with existing BMAD workflows.

## Findings
- **Security & Privacy:** Override reason text is free-form; CLI does not capture secrets by default and uses explicit actor/timestamp logging. Risk remains low so long as operators avoid embedding secrets in the reason string. Recommend reminder in override instructions (already documented in epic update). No sensitive data persisted automatically.
- **Observability:** log persists in `docs/bmad/story-overrides.md` under source control, providing audit history. Story Dev Notes receive override note, ensuring downstream agents (QA/PO) see context.
- **Reliability:** Unit/integration tests prove guard blocks incorrectly sequenced drafts. CLI handles missing `requirements.lock` gracefully (via existing diagnostics tests) and ensures newly created stories get a Dev Notes skeleton.
- **Maintainability:** CLI depends only on stdlib; no external deps introduced. Env variable `BMAD_STORY_OVERRIDE_LOG` documented via tests enabling pipeline overrides. Source tree alignment matches architecture guidance (`src/cli`).
- **Performance:** Negligible impact; CLI operations are file I/O on small markdown/log files.
- **Compatibility:** Works with existing story files; note insertion preserves template anchor. Automation instructions updated in `.bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md` to keep consistent usage.

## Recommendations
- Remind operators during retros to review override log for stale entries or missing follow-up actions.
- Consider adding markdown lint/CI check ensuring override instructions remain referenced.

## Decision
PASS â€“ NFR expectations met.
