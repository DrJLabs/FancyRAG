# NFR Assessment: Story 5.1

Date: 2025-10-06
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Security
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Pipeline logs continue to wrap outputs with `scrub_object`, preventing credential leakage (`tests/unit/cli/test_sanitizer.py::test_scrub_object_scrubs_sensitive_keys`), and helper extraction keeps sensitive configuration flowing through explicit parameters instead of ad-hoc global reads (`src/fancyrag/kg/phases.py`).

## Performance
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Helper decomposition preserved splitter caching guarantees (`tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_pipeline.py::test_run_pipeline_reuses_cached_splitter_results`) and kept semantic enrichment concurrency adjustable through injected options (`src/fancyrag/kg/phases.py::ingest_source`).

## Reliability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: QA orchestration still rolls back on gate failure (`tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_phases.py::test_perform_qa_failure_rolls_back`) and the minimal-path smoke continues to validate the orchestrated flow end-to-end (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py::test_minimal_path_smoke`).

## Maintainability
- Status: Pass
- Notes: Helper guard test now enforces dependency injection boundaries (`tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_phases.py::test_helpers_do_not_touch_environment`), and documentation lint ensures the architecture shard stays current (`tests/unit/docs/architecture/test_helper_references.py::test_architecture_doc_lists_pipeline_helpers`).

## Action Items
1. Keep the helper guard and documentation lint in CI to catch regressions as new helpers are added.
2. Capture minimal-path smoke evidence after next orchestration update to reinforce end-to-end assurance.
