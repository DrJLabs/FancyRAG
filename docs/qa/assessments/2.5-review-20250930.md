# QA Review: Story 2.5 – Minimal Path Script Automation

Date: 2025-09-30
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
- Assets: `scripts/create_vector_index.py`, `scripts/kg_build.py`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/samples/pilot.txt`
- Automation: `tests/unit/scripts/test_create_vector_index.py`, `tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`, existing `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`

## Summary Assessment
- **Alignment:** Scripts and documentation satisfy acceptance criteria, delivering production-ready ingestion tooling with guardrails and updated operator guidance.
- **Code Quality:** Shared OpenAI client reuse keeps retry/backoff consistent; structured logging feeds smoke automation; CLI options match minimal-path defaults.
- **Testing:** Unit suites cover Neo4j index idempotency, retry ceilings, and logging; full compose smoke executed locally on 2025-09-30 with Neo4j 5.26.12 + Qdrant v1.15.4 (see Evidence) while we continue tracking CI credential provisioning.
- **Documentation:** Runbook, sample corpus, and story QA sections now reference concrete commands, log locations, and follow-up steps.

## Findings
- CI smoke run still depends on dedicated non-production OpenAI keys before we can automate in GitHub Actions; local compose smoke validated the upgraded stack on 2025-09-30.
- Capture sanitized log fixtures in repo to support Story 2.6 export validation assertions.

## Evidence (2025-09-30 PM)
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.neo4j-qdrant.yml up -d`
- `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src python3 scripts/create_vector_index.py --index-name chunks_vec --label Chunk --embedding-property embedding --dimensions 1024 --similarity cosine`
- `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src python3 scripts/kg_build.py --source docs/samples/pilot.txt --log-path artifacts/local_stack/test_log.json`
- `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src python3 scripts/export_to_qdrant.py --collection chunks_main --batch-size 64`
- `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src python3 scripts/ask_qdrant.py --collection chunks_main --question "What did Acme launch?" --top-k 3`
- `PYTHONPATH=stubs:src pytest tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`

## Recommendation
- **Gate Ready (with monitor):** Approve for Ready for Review/Gate with explicit follow-up to execute Compose smoke once credentials are provisioned.
