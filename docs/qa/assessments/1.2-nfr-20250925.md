# NFR Assessment: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Quality Score: 100

## Scope
Assessed NFRs: security, performance, reliability, maintainability

## Findings
### Security — PASS
- Evidence: `.env.example` uses non-secret placeholders (`YOUR_…`) with unit guards; documentation warns operators to never commit populated files. References: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_placeholders_are_safe; docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration.
- Risk: Low. Template enforces safe defaults and tests fail if placeholders drift.

### Performance — PASS
- Evidence: Story only introduces configuration template and documentation; no runtime code or data-path changes. No performance targets impacted.
- Risk: Low. Operational footprint unchanged.

### Reliability — PASS
- Evidence: Automated guard tests ensure required keys remain present, preventing runtime bootstrap failures due to missing configuration. References: tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py::test_env_template_contains_required_keys.
- Risk: Low. Early CI detection limits operator-facing outages.

### Maintainability — PASS
- Evidence: Documentation updated with explicit workflow; guard tests provide regression protection and are quick to execute (`pytest` suite 16.5s). References: docs/architecture/overview.md; pytest results recorded in story debug log.
- Risk: Low. Template + docs + tests are concise and easy to update.

## Recommendations
- Keep the guard suite in mandatory CI jobs to preserve coverage.
- Re-run NFR assessment if additional services or env variables are introduced.
