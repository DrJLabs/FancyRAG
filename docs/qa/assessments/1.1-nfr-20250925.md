# NFR Assessment: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS — Integration test confirms operator messaging omits secrets even when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present; script never echoes sensitive values.
- Performance: PASS — Bootstrap is a developer-only script with no latency SLAs; executions finish locally within seconds.
- Reliability: PASS — Import validation failure path exercised via `BOOTSTRAP_TEST_IMPORT=fail`, and rerun behaviour covered by idempotency test.
- Maintainability: PASS — Lockfile is deterministic (pip-tools fallback included), tests guard against regressions, and documentation has been updated.

## Critical Issues
- None.

## Quick Wins
- Add CI job that runs `scripts/bootstrap.sh` nightly without skip flags to catch upstream package issues.
