# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 3.4 (Documentation Lint Automation)

Date: 2025-10-02
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Security
- **Status:** PASS
- `scripts/check_docs.py` reads documentation files only; no secrets processed.
- Sanitization via `cli.sanitizer.scrub_object` ensures JSON output omits sensitive data.
- `.env` loading change respects priority of live environment variables and does not log secret contents.

## Performance
- **Status:** PASS
- Lint guard scans two targeted files, completing in <1s locally and within CI acceptance thresholds.
- Minimal impact on pipeline runtime; smoke workflow executed with stack, showing negligible added latency.

## Reliability
- **Status:** PASS
- Unit + integration coverage exercise success/failure paths, including missing file handling.
- Minimal-path smoke integration confirms lint guard runs against deployed stack.
- Automated JSON artifact enables deterministic CI evidence; failures exit non-zero.

## Maintainability
- **Status:** PASS
- Lint rules centralized in `DEFAULT_RULES`; easy to extend with new tokens.
- Source-tree and overview documentation updated with instructions and override knob (`FANCYRAG_DOTENV_PATH`).
- Unit tests guard expected behaviour, reducing regression risk.

## Observability
- Structured log entry (`documentation_lint_completed`) includes status/evidence for dashboards.
- Artifacts stored under `artifacts/docs/` for QA review; smoke variant `check_docs_smoke.json` generated after end-to-end run.

## Recommendations
- Monitor lint job duration and failure counts in CI to tune token list as documentation grows.
- Consider nightly run across docs tree if additional shards become critical.

## Conclusion
Story 3.4 meets non-functional requirements. No blocking follow-ups identified.
