# Product Owner Validation – Story 3.1 (Adaptive Chunking Profiles & Source-Aware Ingestion)

Date: 2025-10-01
Owner: Sarah (PO)

## Summary
- QA gate status: PASS (monitor) with performance follow-up recorded in docs/qa/gates/3.1-adaptive-chunking.yml.
- Documentation updates verified (README.md, docs/architecture/overview.md) and align with new CLI options.
- All tasks/ACs marked complete, tests executed via `pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py tests/unit/scripts/test_export_to_qdrant.py`.

## Findings
- Story is implementation-complete; ingestion telemetry now captures per-file and per-chunk metadata for downstream consumers.
- Remaining action: schedule compose smoke run when credentials available to close performance monitor item (tracked in QA gate).

## Decision
- GO — story ready for merge/release sequencing.
- Confidence: High, pending follow-up noted above.
