# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 4.1 (CLI Bridge for FancyRAG kg_build)

Date: 2025-10-03
Assessor: Quinn (QA)

## Security
- **Status:** PASS
- `ensure_env` is invoked before establishing clients, preventing silent execution when env secrets are absent (`src/fancyrag/cli/kg_build_main.py:2099-2107`).
- Sanitization continues to rely on `cli.sanitizer.scrub_object`, so run logs do not leak credentials.
- No new environment variables or persisted secrets were introduced.

## Performance
- **Status:** PASS
- The CLI still executes the same pipeline path; argument defaults and batching logic remain unchanged.
- Optional semantic enrichment limits concurrency via existing flag plumbing, so no regression expected.
- `scripts/kg_build.py --help` parity snapshots confirm no new heavyweight defaults were added.

## Reliability
- **Status:** PASS
- Wrapper delegates to the packaged entry point, eliminating duplicate logic and reducing drift (`scripts/kg_build.py:1-9`).
- Unit tests mock the pipeline to ensure env checks happen before execution and that the wrapper is correctly wired (`tests/unit/fancyrag/cli/test_kg_build_main.py`).
- Existing kg_build test suite still passes, exercising rollback and QA threshold behaviour (`tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`).

## Maintainability
- **Status:** PASS
- Source tree documentation now records the FancyRAG CLI package, aiding discoverability (`docs/architecture/source-tree.md:23-74`).
- The change aligns the codebase with the planned FancyRAG module layout, clearing the path for the remaining epic stories.
- Story Dev Notes and completion log capture artefact locations and command history for future reference.

## Observability
- **Status:** PASS
- Log formatting and QA reporting remain untouched, and parity snapshots show operator-facing help text unchanged.
- New unit tests assert the presence of env validation, preventing silent misconfiguration scenarios that would otherwise surface only at runtime.

## Recommendations
- Integrate the CLI help snapshot step into CI to guard against future flag regressions (covers risk TECH-041).
- When Story 4.2 extracts the pipeline module, ensure its unit tests continue to import through `fancyrag.cli.kg_build_main` to maintain end-to-end coverage.

## Conclusion
Story 4.1 satisfies non-functional expectations. No blockers identified; continue monitoring CLI smoke results once pipeline extraction begins.
