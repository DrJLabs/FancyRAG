# QA Review – Story 3.2 Ingestion QA Telemetry & Quality Gate

Date: 2025-10-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
- Code: `scripts/kg_build.py`, `tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- QA collateral: risk profile, test design, traceability, NFR assessment

## Summary
Story delivers pre-commit QA gating with rollback, versioned reporting, duration metrics, and sanitized artifacts. Unit coverage now includes success/failure paths plus sanitization regression. Remaining work is observational: baseline runtime on larger corpora and extend integration smoke once the local stack harness is active again.

## Findings

### Strengths
1. **Pre-commit QA gate with rollback** – `test_run_fails_on_qa_threshold` exercises rollback queries, preventing partial Neo4j/Qdrant writes.
2. **Sanitized, versioned QA artifacts** – JSON/Markdown reports pass through `scrub_object`; regression ensures `/tmp` paths are removed.
3. **Performance observability** – `qa_evaluation_ms` captured per run and surfaced in the log for benchmarking.

### Follow-ups (non-blocking)
1. **Performance baseline**
   - Severity: low
   - Evidence: Duration metrics recorded but no large-corpus benchmark yet
   - Recommendation: Capture runtime delta on representative dataset and document acceptable envelope
2. **Integration smoke enhancement**
   - Severity: low
   - Evidence: QA path validated with fake driver; compose smoke not yet QA-enabled
   - Recommendation: Extend `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py` when Docker/OpenAI pipeline is available

## Recommendations
- Schedule runtime baseline measurement alongside the next ingestion QA exercise.
- Track integration-smoke enhancement in backlog for when local stack automation resumes.

Gate decision: PASS (see `docs/qa/gates/3.2-ingestion-qa-telemetry.yml`).
