  _assessed:
  - security

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: HTTPS-only enforcement blocks insecure overrides unless flag explicitly set.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Override reuses existing retry/backoff logic; no new latency risk.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: FancyRAG pipeline regression runs successfully with neo4j/pandas stubs and diagnostics probe smoke coverage.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Configuration knob documented, unit-tested, and telemetry-masked.
