nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Scripts reuse sanitization helpers; logs redact secrets; unit tests run without exposing credentials."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Retries capped by OPENAI_MAX_ATTEMPTS; chunking defaults aligned with local resource constraints."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Docker compose smoke executed locally with OpenAI credentials (pytest tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Documentation, CLI parameters, and structured logs simplify operator workflows and future automation."
