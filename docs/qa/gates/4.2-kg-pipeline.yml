    title: "Pipeline extraction misses semantic/QA toggles"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Maintain characterization tests for semantic + QA toggles as additional modules extract."
      - "Document and lint CLI â†’ pipeline import direction to prevent circular dependencies."
    monitor:
      - "Spot-check reset behaviour against staging datasets post-merge."
      - "Verify architecture/source-tree shards stay current as modules ship."
