  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lint guard operates on docs and scrubs JSON output; no secrets surfaced."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Targeted token checks complete rapidly; negligible impact on pipeline."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Unit/integration coverage plus smoke execution confirm deterministic behaviour across environments."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Rules centralized and documented; tests enforce behaviour and .env discovery override provided."
