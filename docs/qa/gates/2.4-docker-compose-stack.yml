nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Secrets sourced from .env; helper script avoids echoing credentials; smoke outputs redacted placeholders."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health checks gate container readiness; CI limits compose usage to lint + smoke run."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Unit + integration tests cover health checks, restart policy, and helper error handling; smoke workflow exercises full command sequence."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Documentation + automation reduce operator toil; production-parity checklist tracks enhancements."
