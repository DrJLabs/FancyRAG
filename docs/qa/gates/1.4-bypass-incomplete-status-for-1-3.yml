    title: Enforce CLI guard in automation
  recommendations:
    sustain:
      - Keep guard unit/integration tests in CI smoke stage.
    monitor:
      - Review override log during sprint ceremonies; ensure reasons avoid sensitive data.

  rationale: |
    Guard prevents silent bypass, captures override context, and documentation + tests cover ACs. Residual risks are low and mitigated via monitoring.
  follow_up:
    - Automate markdown lint for override workflow references when tooling available.
