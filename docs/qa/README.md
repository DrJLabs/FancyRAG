# QA Workspace

This directory aggregates quality artifacts for Neo4j GraphRAG.

## Current Scope
- Track QA gates, risk assessments, and test design outputs generated by BMAD tooling.
- Store validation evidence (logs, metrics summaries) referenced by QA decisions.

## Initial Actions
- When stories are ready for QA review, place gate YAML files under `docs/qa/gates/` with the prescribed naming convention (`<epic>.<story>-<slug>.yml`).
- Archive traceability matrices, risk profiles, and test plans in subdirectories aligned with BMAD tasks.
- Update this README with links to created assets as the project matures.
