# Story 5.1: Pipeline Orchestrator Decomposition

## Status
Done — 2025-10-06

## Story
**As a** FancyRAG maintainer,
**I want** the monolithic pipeline orchestration split into composable functions and lightweight classes,
**so that** each ingestion phase can be tested and iterated independently without re-reading global state.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extract helper functions/classes for `resolve_settings()`, `discover_sources()`, `build_clients()`, `ingest_source()`, `run_semantic_enrichment()`, and `perform_qa()`, leaving `run_pipeline()` as a thin coordinator. [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]
2. Ensure each helper accepts explicit parameters (no direct `os.environ` usage) and returns typed results suitable for isolated unit tests. [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]
3. Update unit tests to cover each helper (mocks/stubs acceptable) and extend integration smoke coverage to verify behaviour parity with the previous orchestration. [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]
4. Document the new call graph in `docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md` and reference the extracted functions in relevant shards. [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Catalogue current orchestration responsibilities in `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py`, mapping inputs/outputs for each pipeline phase to inform helper boundaries. (AC: 1, 2) [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator] [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py]
- [x] Implement typed helper functions/classes (e.g., `resolve_settings`, `discover_sources`, `build_clients`, `ingest_source`, `run_semantic_enrichment`, `perform_qa`) that receive explicit dependencies and return dataclass-style results, leaving `run_pipeline()` as a thin coordinator. (AC: 1, 2) [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design] [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]
- [x] Refactor CLI entry points (`scripts/kg_build.py`, `fancyrag.cli.kg_build_main`) and downstream pipeline wiring to call the new helpers while preserving existing behaviour and logging. (AC: 1, 2, 3) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#built-in-tool-playbook] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow]
- [x] Add or update unit tests under `tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/` to exercise each helper with mocks/stubs, ensuring explicit inputs/outputs can be validated without relying on global state. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#5-testing-strategy]
- [x] Extend the integration smoke (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`) to confirm CLI orchestrations still produce identical ingestion, enrichment, and QA artefacts. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/stories/4.8.tests-and-smoke.md#testing] [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]
- [x] Update `docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md` (and any related shards) to capture the helper-based call graph and note the new typed interfaces. (AC: 4) [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.8 established regression parity expectations for unit coverage and the minimal-path smoke; reuse its testing emphasis to prove the refactored orchestrator keeps behaviour identical. [Source: docs/stories/4.8.tests-and-smoke.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- The helpers must continue to populate Document and Chunk nodes through `SimpleKGPipeline` without altering schema contracts or QA counters. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow]

### API Specifications
- Preserve CLI entry points (`scripts/kg_build.py`, `fancyrag.cli.kg_build_main`) and guardrails described in the built-in tool playbook while rerouting the orchestration through helper functions. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#built-in-tool-playbook]
- Ensure the pipeline maintains compatibility with GraphRAG embedders, QA evaluators, and Neo4j/Qdrant clients as outlined in the module-level design. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design]

### Component Specifications
- Keep helper implementations within the FancyRAG package boundaries (`src/fancyrag/kg/`) and respect the CLI → pipeline → QA/DB import direction documented for the refactor. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design] [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout]

### File Locations
- House new helper modules/classes under `src/fancyrag/kg/` (e.g., `phases.py` or similar) and mirror coverage under `tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/`, updating `__init__.py` exports as needed. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow the coding standards and testing strategy: add focused unit suites per helper, re-run the minimal-path smoke, and ensure pytest continues to run with `PYTHONPATH=src`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#5-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Continue targeting Python 3.12 with pinned GraphRAG dependencies, avoid direct `os.environ` access inside helpers, and maintain structured logging/backoff guardrails. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules] [Source: docs/prd.md#story-51-decompose-the-pipeline-orchestrator]

### Project Structure Notes
- No standalone `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` shard exists; rely on the source tree blueprint when creating helper modules and aligning tests. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint] [Source: docs/stories/2.5.minimal-path-scripts.md#project-structure-notes]

## Testing
- Pending — final commands to be confirmed during implementation while following Testing Requirements above.

### Review Date: 2025-10-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Helper extraction keeps `run_pipeline()` thin while unit suites confirm ingestion, QA, and settings helpers remain parameter-driven.
- Sanitised pipeline logs (`scrub_object`) prevent credential leakage; architecture shard reflects the helper call graph update.

### Refactoring Performed
- None — review focused on validation; no code changes applied during QA.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ — Matches `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for typing, logging, and error handling.
- Project Structure: ✓ — Helper modules live under `src/fancyrag/kg/` as documented in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ — Targeted unit guard + architecture lint executed; schedule next minimal-path smoke for final proof.
- All ACs Met: ✓ — Trace matrix confirms AC1–AC4 coverage with automated enforcement.

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Add pytest guard to fail when helper functions access `os.environ` directly.
- [x] Introduce documentation lint ensuring helper references stay in sync (`docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md`).
- [x] Capture fresh minimal-path smoke evidence (command + artifacts) once guards land.

### Test Evidence
- `PYTHONPATH=src LOCAL_STACK_SKIP_DOCKER_CHECK=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=test NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687 NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j NEO4J_PASSWORD=local-neo4j pytest tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py::test_minimal_path_smoke -q`
  → `artifacts/local_stack/test_log.json`

### Security Review
- Sanitization layer continues masking secrets before logging; helper interfaces avoid direct environment reads.

### Performance Considerations
- Splitter caching and semantic concurrency tunables preserved; no new synchronous bottlenecks observed.
