# Story 2.4: Docker Compose Stack for Neo4j + Qdrant

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** GraphRAG operator,
**I want** a project-owned Docker Compose stack for Neo4j 5.26.12 with APOC Core and Qdrant 1.15.4 (see [Version Matrix](../README.md#version-matrix)) that honours shared environment settings,
**so that** I can stand up the local minimal path without touching managed infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add `docker-compose.neo4j-qdrant.yml` at the repository root provisioning Neo4j 5.26.12 (APOC Core enabled) and Qdrant 1.15.4 with persistent volumes under `./.data/neo4j` and `./.data/qdrant`, exposing ports `7474/7687` and `6333`, and consuming credentials via `.env` (`NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`).

2. Compose services include documented health checks, APOC plugin mounts, and restart policies so that reruns of `docker compose up` remain idempotent and align with the minimal-path workflow’s expectations for `SimpleKGPipeline`, Qdrant export, and `GraphRAG.search()` scripts.

3. Update documentation (e.g., `docs/architecture/overview.md` and linked operator guides) with runbooks covering boot, teardown, `.env` overrides, and compatibility guidance for promoting the stack to CI, matching logging/retry standards. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/local-stack/epic.md#epic-goal] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#logging-guidance]
4. Provide automated verification: a CI-safe check (`docker compose config` + lint) and an integration smoke workflow that starts the stack, runs `scripts/create_vector_index.py`, `scripts/kg_build.py`, `scripts/export_to_qdrant.py`, and `scripts/ask_qdrant.py`, then tears down cleanly, ensuring logs remain redacted and exit codes propagate.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Author `docker-compose.neo4j-qdrant.yml` with versioned Neo4j and Qdrant images, persistent volumes, health checks, and `.env`-driven credentials (AC: 1,2). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration]
  - [x] Enable APOC Core via Neo4j plugins/`apoc.conf`, ensure Bolt/HTTP ports map to documented defaults, and add restart/backoff policies aligned with coding standards (AC: 1,2). [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#technical-summary] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- [x] Document operator workflow updates in `docs/architecture/overview.md` (and ancillary shards) covering boot/teardown commands, `.env` overrides, and CI usage (AC: 3). [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration]
  - [x] Cross-link to workspace bootstrap + diagnostics instructions so the sequence reads: bootstrap → `.env` → compose → scripts → teardown (AC: 3). [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#workspace-verification]
- [x] Add automation: CLI or Make target for `docker compose config` validation plus CI job stub (AC: 4). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]
  - [x] Create integration smoke test harness (pytest or shell) that spins up the stack, runs all minimal-path scripts against sample content, cleans volumes, and asserts success logs (AC: 4). [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#minimal-path-workflow]
- [x] Update `.env.example` / configuration references to surface required variables, default ports, and override guidance without exposing secrets (AC: 1,3). [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration]
- [x] Prepare follow-up checklist for production parity (image tags, APOC config, volume retention) to mitigate drift when mirroring managed environments (AC: 2). [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/local-stack/epic.md#risk-mitigation]

- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-09-28T09:04:04.840579+00:00
- Actor: ScrumMaster
- Prior Story: 2.3
- Prior Status: Draft
- Reason: Kick off Local Stack epic while Story 2.3 is Draft

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3’s diagnostics workflow already validates Neo4j, Qdrant, and OpenAI imports; ensure compose instructions reference running diagnostics after stack boot. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.environment-validation-command.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.3 (OpenAI shared client) is Done; compose documentation and smoke tests must reuse `SharedOpenAIClient` so retries, telemetry, and sanitisation stay aligned with the shared wrapper. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.openai-shared-client.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.5 (Minimal Path Script Automation) will supply the ingestion scripts consumed by this compose stack; sequence implementation so Story 2.5 fixtures are available before finalising the integration smoke test. [Source: docs/stories/2.5.minimal-path-scripts.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- Minimal path scripts rely on Neo4j knowledge graph nodes and embeddings produced by `SimpleKGPipeline`; compose volumes must persist graph data between runs. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#high-level-components]

### API Specifications
- Compose services expose Neo4j Bolt/HTTP and Qdrant HTTP endpoints consumed by scripts; maintain default URIs (`bolt://localhost:7687`, `http://localhost:6333`) consistent with `.env` guidance. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration]

### Component Specifications
- Neo4j container must load APOC Core plugin and accept configuration via mounted `conf/` folder or environmental flags. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/local-stack/epic.md#epic-description]
- Qdrant service should support persistent storage paths for payloads so vector exports remain idempotent. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/local-stack/epic.md#epic-description]

### File Locations
- Place compose file at repository root alongside existing scripts per source tree blueprint. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]
- Document updates live in `docs/architecture/overview.md` and reference minimal path steps. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#minimal-path-workflow]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow coding standards: use pytest integration suites or scripted harnesses that avoid leaking secrets, reuse structured logging assertions, and tear down containers to keep CI deterministic. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]
- Smoke workflow must execute all minimal path scripts in order while verifying exit codes and redacted logs. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#minimal-path-workflow]

### Technical Constraints
- Target Docker Compose 2.x, Neo4j 5.26.12 with APOC Core, Qdrant 1.15.4, and ensure compatibility with Python 3.12 scripts. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack]
- Scripts invoked by smoke tests must continue to honour `.env` overrides for managed deployments. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration]
- Production parity checklist recorded at `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-production-parity-checklist.md` to track digest pinning and APOC override parity before promoting to managed environments.

### Project Structure Notes
- Update `docs/bmad/story-overrides.md` already captures override; ensure future stories reconcile sequencing once Story 2.3 is completed. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/local-stack/epic.md#story-override-workflow]

### Documentation Alignment
- Compose runbook now documents `scripts/check_local_stack.sh` usage, sequencing with diagnostics and OpenAI probes. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#workspace-verification]

### Secrets Handling
- Never bake credentials into compose file; rely on `.env` or Docker secrets while masking logs per coding standards. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Monitoring & Observability
- Ensure stack logging integrates with existing structured logging expectations so pipeline telemetry remains consumable once scripts run; stub scripts emit structured JSON until Story 2.5 delivers full telemetry. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#logging-guidance]

## Testing
- Integration smoke test: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py` spins up compose stack, runs all minimal path scripts sequentially, validates redacted logs, and tears down containers (AC 4). [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#minimal-path-workflow]
- CLI lint: add CI step executing `docker compose -f docker-compose.neo4j-qdrant.yml config` to catch syntax drift (AC 4). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]
- Optional local script: provide `scripts/check_local_stack.sh` to wrap config validation and health checks for operators. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#environment-configuration]

## QA Results
### Risk Profile
- **Likelihood: Medium / Impact: High** — Misconfigured compose services (ports, APOC mounts, credentials) would break all downstream minimal-path scripts. Mitigation: re-use env defaults from Story 1.x workspace docs, add compose health checks, and cover with AC4 smoke workflow.
- **Likelihood: Medium / Impact: Medium** — Container drift vs. production (image tags, APOC config) could erode parity. Mitigation: production-parity checklist plus pinned image digests and CI guard measuring version drift.
- **Likelihood: Low / Impact: High** — Secrets logged by compose scripts. Mitigation: enforce `.env` usage, reuse sanitization helpers, and include log redaction assertions in integration test.
- **Likelihood: Medium / Impact: Medium** — Compose cleanup failure leaving residual volumes. Mitigation: ensure smoke test tears down with `--volumes` option and document manual cleanup steps in runbook.
- Full assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.4-risk-20250929.md

### Test Design
- **Compose lint:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.neo4j-qdrant.yml config` as CI job to validate syntax, environment substitutions, and plugin mounts (AC4).
- **Container health check validation:** Local test invoking `docker compose up -d` then polling `docker compose ps --format json` to ensure Neo4j + Qdrant report healthy status before scripts run (AC2).
- **Minimal-path smoke:** Pytest or shell harness that, against running compose stack, executes `create_vector_index.py`, `kg_build.py`, `export_to_qdrant.py`, `ask_qdrant.py`; asserts shared OpenAI client metrics emitted, verifies grounded answer, and tears down with `docker compose down --volumes` (AC4, dependency on Story 2.5 artifacts).
- **Documentation checks:** Automated doc test (e.g., Sphinx doctest or markdown lint workflow) ensuring commands in updated runbook reference correct filenames and environment variables (AC3).
- **Secrets regression:** Unit test verifying compose file and helper scripts never log raw credentials, exercising sanitization paths introduced in Story 2.3 (AC2/AC4).

### Traceability
- 2025-09-29 — Partial coverage documented in docs/qa/assessments/2.4-trace-20250929.md (AC1/AC2/AC4 automation pending; smoke depends on Story 2.5).

### NFR Assessment
- 2025-09-29 — Security/Performance/Maintainability PASS; Reliability remains CONCERNS until restart automation + smoke execution land. See docs/qa/assessments/2.4-nfr-20250929.md.

### QA Review
- 2025-09-29 — Ready for continued QA. Outstanding: production-parity checklist, Story 2.5 smoke enablement, remaining P0 tests (docs/qa/assessments/2.4-review-20250929.md).

### QA Gate
- 2025-09-29 — CONCERNS. Gate blocks completion until parity checklist authored and automation gaps closed (docs/qa/gates/2.4-docker-compose-stack.yml).

### PO Validation
- 2025-09-29 — Approved – Ready for Development. PO confirmed story alignment with Epic 2, QA coverage, and dependency sequencing; follow-ups: schedule smoke automation after Story 2.5 scripts land, create production-parity checklist artifact, and coordinate CI resource limits. See docs/qa/assessments/2.4-po-validation-20250929.md.
