# Story 1.2: Environment Configuration Template

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** GraphRAG operator,
**I want** a documented `.env` template covering OpenAI, Neo4j, and Qdrant configuration,
**so that** I can supply required secrets safely and run CLI workflows without guesswork.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `.env.example` enumerates placeholders for OpenAI API access, Neo4j Bolt credentials, and Qdrant endpoint/API key with inline guardrails so operators can populate secrets after bootstrap. [Source: bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md#story-manager-handoff] [Source: prd.md#epic-1--environment--workspace] [Source: architecture.md#cli-orchestrator]
2. Documentation instructs operators to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, explains each variable, and reinforces that secrets stay out of version control. [Source: prd.md#non-functional] [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
3. Guidance captures default OpenAI model selections (`gpt-4o-mini` default, optional `gpt-4.1-mini`) and references service endpoints so configuration aligns with PRD expectations. [Source: prd.md#functional] [Source: architecture.md#high-level-overview]
4. Checklist or automated validation ensures repository tooling (tests or lint) fails if required `.env` keys are missing from the template to prevent regressions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Author `.env.example` under repo root with placeholders for OpenAI, Neo4j, and Qdrant configuration plus comments pointing to documentation (AC: 1,3). [Source: bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md#story-manager-handoff] [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]
  - [x] Annotate template entries with guidance on copying to `.env` and keeping secrets out of VCS (AC: 1,2). [Source: prd.md#non-functional] [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- [x] Extend documentation (e.g., `docs/architecture/overview.md` or dedicated config guide) describing variable meanings, default model selections, and setup sequence post-bootstrap (AC: 2,3). [Source: architecture/overview.md#high-level-components] [Source: prd.md#functional]
  - [x] Link documentation back to the bootstrap script flow so operators understand when to populate `.env` (AC: 2). [Source: stories/1.1.workspace-bootstrap-script.md#completion-notes-list]
- [x] Add automated check (pytest, lint, or CI script) failing when required `.env` keys change or disappear to keep template reliable (AC: 4). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 completion notes direct operators to populate the `.env` template immediately after running the bootstrap script, so documentation must maintain that handoff. [Source: stories/1.1.workspace-bootstrap-script.md#completion-notes-list]

### Configuration Requirements
- `.env` variables must cover OpenAI API key/model selection, Neo4j Bolt credentials, and Qdrant URL + API key to satisfy integration points. [Source: bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md#story-manager-handoff]
- Epic goal expects operators to fill the template within 30 minutes, so instructions need to be concise and actionable. [Source: bmad/focused-epics/environment-workspace/epic.md#epic-goal]

### Service Context
- Repository targets managed Neo4j database `graphrag`, Qdrant collection `grag_main_v1`, and OpenAI SaaS endpoints; template comments should reference these services for clarity. [Source: architecture.md#high-level-overview]

### Secrets Handling
- Never commit real credentials; reinforce copying `.env.example` to `.env` and rely on gitignore safeguards. [Source: prd.md#non-functional] [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Project Structure
- Place `.env.example` in repository root alongside scripts to align with documented source tree layout. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]

### Technical Constraints
- Solution continues to run on Python 3.12 with pinned dependencies established by bootstrap script; template should not alter that workflow. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack]

### Testing
- Use `pytest` to assert `.env.example` lists required keys and documentation references it, avoiding external service calls while checking for regressions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]

### Data Models
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs beyond referencing OpenAI/Qdrant endpoints above.

### Component Specifications
- No additional component-level instructions beyond CLI orchestrator loading `.env`; defer to configuration requirements. [Source: architecture.md#cli-orchestrator]

### File Locations
- Template lives at repo root while related docs updates belong under `docs/architecture/` shards per structure blueprint. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]

## Testing
- Add unit test verifying `.env.example` exposes required keys and matches documentation references.
- Add regression test or CI script that fails when template entries are removed or renamed.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
GPT-5 Codex (CLI)

### Debug Log References
* `pytest tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py`
* `pytest`

### Completion Notes List

* Created `.env.example` with guarded placeholders and documented optional model override.
* Updated `docs/architecture/overview.md` with copy workflow, default model guidance, and secret-handling reminders.
* Added unit guard suite under `tests/unit/config/test_env_template.py` enforcing required keys, safe placeholders, docs linkage, and endpoint hints; full test suite now passes.

## ðŸ”¬ Research & Validation Log
- Mode: solo (2025-09-25)
- Findings: Template must include OpenAI GPT defaults, Neo4j/Qdrant endpoints, and secret-handling guardrails consistent with architecture docs.
- Sources: docs/prd.md#epic-1--environment--workspace, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules, docs/stories/1.1.workspace-bootstrap-script.md#completion-notes-list
- Residual Risks: Template drift if env keys change without tests; mitigate via automated check (AC4).
- Next Actions: Implement `.env` template, update docs, add pytest guard.
