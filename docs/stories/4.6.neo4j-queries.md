# Story 4.6: Neo4j Query Helpers Module

## Status
On Hold — 2025-10-04

## Story
**As a** FancyRAG pipeline maintainer,
**I want** the Neo4j ingestion and rollback Cypher helpers extracted into a dedicated database module shared by pipeline and QA components,
**so that** ingestion runs keep consistent, testable graph mutations aligned with the refactor guardrails while preserving existing CLI behaviour.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement `src/fancyrag/db/neo4j_queries.py` housing reset, document relationship, rollback, and QA count helpers currently embedded in the pipeline/evaluator, exposing typed functions that accept a Neo4j driver, optional database name, and structured payloads without altering query semantics.

2. Refactor `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py` to invoke the new helpers, retaining ingest run key handling, rollback semantics, relative-path provenance updates, and the CLI → pipeline → db import direction documented for the refactor. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook] [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py]
3. Update `src/fancyrag/qa/evaluator.py` to consume the shared db helpers for graph counts, chunk anomaly queries, and semantic checks so QA gating uses the same Cypher catalogue without duplicating string literals. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design] [Source: docs/stories/4.4.qa-evaluator.md#Acceptance Criteria] [Source: src/fancyrag/qa/evaluator.py]
4. Add automated coverage for the shared db helpers, including unit tests for ingest rollback edge cases, chunk provenance updates, and QA count queries, and close QA’s 4.5 follow-ups by landing integration scenario 4.5-INT-002 (`kg.run --qa-report-dir` against an external directory) plus clearing the `resolve_repo_root` cache issue so `tests/unit/fancyrag/utils/test_paths.py` passes without manual intervention.

5. Update architecture and epic documentation to mark the db module delivered, and provide evidence that Story 4.5’s CONCERNS are closed (updated QA gate, integration test artifacts, and QA sign-off notes).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Catalogue the reset, document relationship, rollback, and QA query helpers in `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py` and `src/fancyrag/qa/evaluator.py` to confirm extraction scope. (AC: 1) [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py] [Source: src/fancyrag/qa/evaluator.py]
- [x] Implement `src/fancyrag/db/neo4j_queries.py` with typed functions that encapsulate the shared Cypher catalogue, preserving sanitisation, ingest run key behaviour, and optional database routing. (AC: 1) [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design]
- [x] Refactor pipeline orchestration to import the db helpers, keeping rollback semantics, provenance mutations, and CLI wiring unchanged for operators. (AC: 2) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook] [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py]
- [x] Update the QA evaluator to rely on the shared helpers for counts, anomaly queries, and semantic metrics while maintaining threshold enforcement. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/stories/4.4.qa-evaluator.md#Acceptance Criteria] [Source: src/fancyrag/qa/evaluator.py]
- [x] Add unit tests under `tests/unit/fancyrag/db/`, update pipeline/evaluator tests and fixtures to mock the shared helpers, implement the 4.5-INT-002 integration scenario, and clear the `resolve_repo_root` cache fixture so `tests/unit/fancyrag/utils/test_paths.py` passes without manual intervention. (AC: 4) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations] [Source: docs/stories/4.5.qa-report.md#Risks & Recommendations]
- [x] Refresh `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`, the refactor project shard, and Epic 4 documentation to register the delivered db module and attach QA artifacts demonstrating closure of Story 4.5 CONCERNS (updated gate, integration logs, QA sign-off). (AC: 5) [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Upcoming Module Layout] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design] [Source: docs/stories/4.5.qa-report.md#Risks & Recommendations]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.5 left a QA gate CONCERNS on CLI integration coverage and cached path helpers; ensure the db module extraction coordinates with that follow-up so report/evaluator behaviour remains aligned. [Source: docs/stories/4.5.qa-report.md#Risks & Recommendations]
- Story 4.4 emphasised maintaining the CLI → pipeline → QA import direction; the new db module must slot beneath pipeline/QA without reverse dependencies. [Source: docs/stories/4.4.qa-evaluator.md#Component Specifications]

### Data Models
- Document and Chunk nodes, HAS_CHUNK relationships, and ingest run key semantics must remain untouched when queries move. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow]

### API Specifications
- Preserve pipeline options that govern reset flags, ingest run keys, and provenance fields while routing all graph mutations through the shared helpers. [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook]

### Component Specifications
- The db module should expose pure functions (no global driver state) to keep the module testable and respect the documented module boundary (CLI → pipeline → QA/report/db). [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#2-high-level-design]

### File Locations
- Place the helper module at `src/fancyrag/db/neo4j_queries.py` with mirrored unit tests under `tests/unit/fancyrag/db/` to stay consistent with the source tree blueprint. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Upcoming Module Layout]

### Testing Requirements
- Extend the testing plan with targeted unit coverage for each helper and refresh pipeline/evaluator suites to stub the shared entry points, keeping parity with Story 4.5’s outstanding integration scenario. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#5-Testing Strategy] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations]

### Technical Constraints
- Continue targeting Python 3.12 and the pinned Neo4j driver; driver wrappers in helper tests should avoid external network calls by using in-memory doubles. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack]

### Open Risks & Follow-Ups
- Coordinate with QA to close Story 4.5’s CONCERNS once db helpers land and integration coverage is in place. [Source: docs/stories/4.5.qa-report.md#Risks & Recommendations]
- Story paused on 2025-10-04 to prioritise Story 2.6 (OpenAI custom endpoint); resume once that story returns to Done.
