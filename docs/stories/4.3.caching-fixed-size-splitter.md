# Story 4.3: Caching Splitter Module

## Status
Ready for Done — 2025-10-04

## Story
**As a** FancyRAG pipeline maintainer,
**I want** the caching splitter logic extracted into a dedicated module with reusable configuration hooks,
**so that** the refactored ingestion stack keeps chunking behaviour modular, testable, and aligned with the new package guardrails.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `src/fancyrag/splitters/caching_fixed_size.py` housing the `CachingFixedSizeSplitter` class and scoped caching helpers currently embedded in `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py`, preserving cache key behaviour and unique chunk UID regeneration while meeting module guardrails.

2. Expose reusable configuration hooks (e.g., typed factory or dataclass) in the splitter module so callers can supply chunk size and overlap while keeping the `scoped` context manager available for source-specific caching. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/kg-build-refactor/epic.md#Stories] [Source: docs/prd/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor/project-brief.md#3-project-scope] [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py]
3. Update `fancyrag.kg.pipeline` (and upstream CLI wiring) to import the new splitter module without behaviour changes, maintaining the documented CLI → pipeline → splitters import direction and existing QA/logging data flows. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook] [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout]
4. Refresh or add unit tests covering the splitter module (including scoped cache reuse and UID regeneration) and update existing pipeline/CLI tests to target the new import path, following the testing strategy and coding standards. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#5-Testing Strategy] [Source: tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py]
5. Update architecture documentation (source tree shard and refactor addendum) to mark the splitter module as delivered and keep module diagrams consistent. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Catalogue the existing `CachingFixedSizeSplitter` implementation in `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py`, including scoped caching semantics and CLI configuration touchpoints, to inform extraction scope. (AC: 1, 2) [Source: src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook]
- [x] Implement `src/fancyrag/splitters/caching_fixed_size.py` with the relocated splitter class plus a typed configuration hook for chunk size/overlap while retaining the `scoped` API. (AC: 1, 2) [Source: docs/prd/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor/prd.md#epic-1-kg_buildpy-monolith-decomposition] [Source: docs/prd/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor/project-brief.md#3-project-scope]
- [x] Refactor `fancyrag.kg.pipeline` (and any CLI callers) to import the new module, ensuring pipeline orchestration keeps chunking, QA records, and logging behaviour identical. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow] [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout]
- [x] Add or update unit tests under `tests/unit/fancyrag/splitters/` plus adjust existing pipeline/CLI tests to reference the new module path, verifying scoped caching and UID regeneration. (AC: 4) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#5-Testing Strategy]
- [x] Refresh `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` and `docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md` to reflect the delivered splitter module, keeping the upcoming module layout accurate. (AC: 5) [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.2 moved pipeline orchestration into `fancyrag.kg.pipeline`, so the splitter extraction must preserve the existing chunk metadata flow and dependency validation when delegating. [Source: docs/stories/4.2.kg-pipeline.md#Dev Notes]

### Data Models
- Chunking still feeds Neo4j Document/Chunk nodes via `SimpleKGPipeline`; ensure relocated splitter outputs stay compatible with the existing ingestion schema. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow]

### API Specifications
- The splitter module must continue to integrate with the pipeline’s GraphRAG orchestration (`SimpleKGPipeline`, embedder/LLM clients) without changing public CLI signatures. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#High-Level Components] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#4-data-flow]

### Component Specifications
- Maintain the CLI → pipeline → splitters import direction and keep modules within single-responsibility guardrails defined for the FancyRAG package. [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#3-module-level-design] [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout]

### File Locations
- Place the splitter at `src/fancyrag/splitters/caching_fixed_size.py`, update `src/fancyrag/splitters/__init__.py` if needed, and mirror the structure in `tests/unit/fancyrag/splitters/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#upcoming-module-layout]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow the documented testing strategy: add focused unit coverage for the splitter module and re-run pipeline/CLI tests plus the integration smoke as needed. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md#5-Testing Strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Continue targeting Python 3.12 with the pinned `neo4j-graphrag`, Neo4j, Qdrant, and OpenAI dependencies, and honour coding standard guardrails around retries and structured logging. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards]

### Project Structure Notes
- No dedicated `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` shard exists; rely on the source tree blueprint for placement checks when adding the splitter module. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Source Tree Blueprint] [Source: docs/stories/2.5.minimal-path-scripts.md#Project Structure Notes]

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- ✅ Extracted `CachingFixedSizeSplitter` + caching helpers into `src/fancyrag/splitters/caching_fixed_size.py`, mirroring the prior pipeline implementation while adding the `CachingSplitterConfig` factory without behaviour drift.
- ✅ `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py` now consumes the factory (`build_caching_splitter`) and continues to scope cache usage per source, preserving UID regeneration and metadata wiring.
- ✅ Documentation shards (`docs/architecture/projects/fancyrag-kg-build-refactor.md`, `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`) now point to the delivered module so future work picks up the new layout.

### Requirements Traceability
- **AC1** – Module relocated with identical caching semantics and exported via `fancyrag.splitters`; verified through direct code inspection and unit coverage (`tests/unit/fancyrag/splitters/test_caching_fixed_size.py::test_get_cached_returns_none_before_run`).
- **AC2** – Typed hooks for chunk sizing exposed via `CachingSplitterConfig` + `build_caching_splitter`; validated by `test_build_caching_splitter_supports_config_and_overrides` ensuring config/kwargs parity.
- **AC3** – Pipeline now builds the splitter via the new factory and reuses `scoped` contexts; observed in `src/fancyrag/kg/pipeline.py` lines 1960-2050 and exercised by `tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_pipeline.py`.
- **AC4** – Added splitter-focused unit tests plus updated pipeline/CLI suites; commands below executed cleanly.
- **AC5** – Architecture shards updated to mark the module delivered (see docs listed above).

### Testing
- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/fancyrag/splitters/test_caching_fixed_size.py tests/unit/fancyrag/kg/test_pipeline.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`
- Integration smoke (`tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py`) not rerun; unchanged scope and prior coverage considered sufficient, but rerun before release if the local stack changes.

### Risks & Recommendations
- None blocking. Track upcoming managed-service work to add multi-source regression coverage once integration smoke tests enter CI.

### Status Recommendation
- Ready for Done once downstream stakeholders confirm optional integration smoke rerun timing.
