# Story 2.5: Minimal Path Script Automation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** GraphRAG operator,
**I want** Python scripts that create the Neo4j vector index and run the `SimpleKGPipeline` ingestion workflow against sample content,
**so that** the local minimal path can be executed end-to-end with consistent guardrails, logging, and retries ahead of vector export and retrieval steps.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace the stub `scripts/create_vector_index.py` with a production-ready implementation that connects to Neo4j using shared settings, creates or verifies the `chunks_vec` vector index (1536 dimensions, cosine similarity), idempotently handles reruns, and emits structured JSON logs aligned with coding standards while respecting `.env` overrides.

2. Replace the stub `scripts/kg_build.py` with a full `SimpleKGPipeline` ingestion workflow that loads sample content from `docs/samples/`, leverages `SharedOpenAIClient` for embeddings, streams progress metrics, and gracefully retries OpenAI rate limits while masking secrets.

3. Update documentation (e.g., `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-production-parity-checklist.md`) with ingestion runbooks covering prerequisites (`scripts/check_local_stack.sh --up`), script parameters, `.env` expectations, and teardown sequencing so operators can run the minimal path without guesswork.

4. Upgrade automation (unit + integration smoke) to exercise the real ingestion flow: mock Neo4j/OpenAI at the unit level, ensure retries honour `OPENAI_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, and extend the compose smoke test to assert grounded answers/log redaction for downstream Qdrant export.

## Dev Notes

Warning: override of incomplete story status executed.
- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-09-29T18:28:59.685589+00:00
- Actor: drj
- Prior Story: 2.4
- Prior Status: Draft
- Reason: Unblock script automation while Story 2.4 remains Draft

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.4’s Docker Compose stack establishes Neo4j and Qdrant containers, so these scripts must assume the stack is running and reuse the `.env` configuration documented there. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.docker-compose-neo4j-qdrant.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.3 centralised OpenAI guardrails; leverage `SharedOpenAIClient` for embeddings to avoid duplicated retry and telemetry logic. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.openai-shared-client.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.4 shipped placeholder scripts to unblock smoke automation; this story is responsible for replacing those stubs with production-ready ingestion components before Story 2.6 tackles Qdrant export. [Source: scripts/create_vector_index.py]

### Data Models
- Neo4j graph should persist `Document` and `Chunk` nodes plus relationships created by `SimpleKGPipeline`, with the vector index targeting `Chunk.embedding` at 1536 dimensions. [Source: docs/architecture.md#database--collection-schema]

### API Specifications
- `SimpleKGPipeline` orchestrates embeddings generation and graph writes; ensure scripts expose parameters consistent with documented minimal path commands and honour `.env` overrides for service URIs and credentials. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#minimal-path-workflow]

### Component Specifications
- Scripts belong under `scripts/` and must integrate with shared configuration helpers so future CLI commands remain consistent with the source tree blueprint. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]

### File Locations
- Place new scripts in `scripts/` and sample content under `docs/samples/`, keeping documentation updates within `docs/architecture/overview.md` to align with existing workflow narrative. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow coding standards: provide pytest suites that mock external services, maintain log redaction, and support eventual integration runs against the Compose stack without leaking secrets. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]

### Technical Constraints
- Support Python 3.12 runtime, `neo4j-graphrag[experimental,openai,qdrant]`, Neo4j 5.26, Qdrant ≥ 1.8, and the OpenAI models declared in `.env`. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack]

### Project Structure Notes
- No dedicated `unified-project-structure.md` shard exists; use `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` to verify script placement and naming consistency. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-blueprint]

### Documentation Alignment
- Update the architecture overview so the ingestion steps mirror the new scripts and call out when to rerun diagnostics versus Compose health checks. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#workspace-verification]

### Secrets Handling
- Ensure scripts load credentials from `.env`/environment without logging sensitive values; reuse sanitization helpers for any output. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Monitoring & Observability
- Emit structured logs (`operation`, `status`, `duration_ms`, counts) that feed existing telemetry dashboards and align with expectations set for Compose smoke tests; replace the current "status: skipped" placeholder with real telemetry once pipeline logic is implemented. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#logging-guidance]

## Testing
- Unit tests: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_create_vector_index.py tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py` covering idempotency, retry, and logging behaviour via mocks. ✅ 2025-09-30. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-expectations]
- Integration prep: extend `tests/integration/local_stack/test_minimal_path_smoke.py` (introduced in Story 2.4) or add `tests/integration/local_stack/test_ingest_minimal_path.py` to run the ingestion pipeline end-to-end, producing fixtures for the upcoming export story. [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#minimal-path-workflow]
- Log fixtures: capture JSON log snapshots under `tests/fixtures/minimal_path/` for reuse when verifying Qdrant export telemetry. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/local-stack/epic.md#success-criteria]

## QA Results
### Risk Profile
- **Likelihood: Medium / Impact: High** — Misconfigured vector index specs would block retrieval and downstream export. Mitigation: validate defaults via CLI/unit tests and assert metadata in smoke runs.
- **Likelihood: Medium / Impact: Medium** — Retry/backoff logic may exhaust OpenAI quota or leave partial graphs. Mitigation: reuse shared retry helpers, add unit coverage for `OPENAI_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, and capture telemetry.
- **Likelihood: Medium / Impact: Medium** — Operators may execute scripts without Compose stack ready, leading to opaque driver failures. Mitigation: document `check_local_stack.sh --up`, add preflight checks, and extend smoke coverage.

### Test Design
- **Vector index coverage:** Unit tests guard CLI defaults, index validation, and mismatch diagnostics.
- **Pipeline coverage:** Unit tests mock OpenAI to exercise retries/redaction and ensure deterministic logging; integration smoke to be re-enabled once Docker + OpenAI credentials are provisioned.
- **Operational coverage:** Documentation updates and sample content changes anchor operator runbooks; smoke workflow remains ready for execution when infrastructure is available.
