# Story 3.5: Semantic Enrichment Pipeline & Retrieval Surfacing

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** ingestion QA steward,
**I want** the ingestion pipeline to produce semantic entity and relationship nodes using GraphRAG’s extractor,
**so that** retrieval and telemetry can rely on richer context while preserving adaptive chunking guarantees.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend `scripts/kg_build.py` to invoke GraphRAG `LLMEntityRelationExtractor` after chunk ingestion, persisting Entity and Relationship nodes with relative path, git commit, and checksum metadata inherited from Story 3.1 while keeping default behaviour when the extractor is disabled.

2. Expand ingestion QA gating to capture semantic counts, orphaned entities, and extractor error telemetry inside `artifacts/ingestion/<timestamp>/` reports, failing the run when configurable thresholds are exceeded while preserving rollback guarantees.

3. Surface semantic nodes in `scripts/ask_qdrant.py` (e.g., optional sections in sanitized artefacts and CLI output) and refresh architecture/runbook documentation so the documentation lint guard remains green after the change.

4. Provide unit and integration coverage (including compose smoke) that exercises extractor success/failure paths, QA threshold enforcement, and retrieval output changes without regressing minimal-path defaults.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add a semantic enrichment toggle/flag to `scripts/kg_build.py`, wiring `LLMEntityRelationExtractor` into the existing pipeline while propagating chunk metadata into new entity/relationship nodes. (AC: 1) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#High-Level Components] [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Story Manager Handoff]
- [x] Extend the ingestion QA module to record semantic metrics, persist them under `artifacts/ingestion/`, and enforce thresholds before writes complete. (AC: 1,2) [Source: docs/stories/3.2.ingestion-qa-telemetry.md#Dev Notes] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Script Conventions]
- [x] Update `scripts/ask_qdrant.py` (and related telemetry helpers) to hydrate semantic nodes alongside chunk context and keep sanitised payloads schema-compatible. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/stories/3.3.qdrant-native-retriever.md#Acceptance Criteria] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Minimal Path Workflow]
- [x] Refresh architecture shards and runbook instructions documenting semantic enrichment usage, rerunning the documentation lint guard to validate wording. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/stories/3.4.documentation-lint-automation.md#Acceptance Criteria] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook]
- [x] Add pytest coverage for extractor flow, QA thresholds, and retrieval output plus compose smoke validation, integrating tests into CI. (AC: 4) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Local Stack Automation]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.2 introduced ingestion QA artefacts and gating; extend those metrics with semantic coverage to keep failure handling consistent. [Source: docs/stories/3.2.ingestion-qa-telemetry.md#Dev Notes]
- Story 3.3 replaced bespoke retrieval joins with `QdrantNeo4jRetriever`, so semantic payloads must preserve existing match schemas while adding optional enrichment. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.qdrant-native-retriever.md#Dev Notes]
- Story 3.4’s documentation lint guard will fail unless architecture shards describe the new semantic workflow; update docs in lockstep. [Source: docs/stories/3.4.documentation-lint-automation.md#Acceptance Criteria]

### Data Models
- Neo4j maintains `Document`, `Chunk`, and SimpleKGPipeline-created entity/relationship nodes; ensure new enrichment reuses these schemas and vector index contracts. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Database & Collection Schema]

### API Specifications
- Leverage GraphRAG’s knowledge builder extractor APIs (`LLMEntityRelationExtractor`) as documented in the official user guide for semantic enrichment. [Source: docs/graphrag/OFFICIAL_LINKS.md#User Guides]

### Component Specifications
- No specific UI component requirements noted in architecture docs.

### File Locations
- Ingestion scripts and CLI helpers live under `scripts/` and `src/cli/`; QA artefacts persist beneath `artifacts/ingestion/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Source Tree Blueprint]

### Testing Requirements
- Tests must reside under `tests/unit/scripts/` and `tests/integration/local_stack/`, reuse pytest fixtures, and validate both happy-path and failure telemetry. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations]

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.12 environment with `neo4j-graphrag[experimental,openai,qdrant]`, structlog logging, and retry guardrails remain mandatory. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards]

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
- Codex (GPT-5)

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List
- Added an optional semantic enrichment pass to `scripts/kg_build.py`, wiring `LLMEntityRelationExtractor` with provenance tagging, CLI switches, and ingest rollback support.
- Extended ingestion QA to record semantic metrics, enforce new thresholds, and expose the data in run logs while keeping reports sanitized.
- Plumbed semantic context into `scripts/ask_qdrant.py` behind an opt-in flag and refreshed unit coverage plus architecture documentation to guide operators through the new workflow.
