# Story 3.2: Ingestion QA Telemetry & Quality Gate

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** FancyRAG operator responsible for ingestion health,
**I want** automated QA telemetry and gating after each ingestion run,
**so that** I can spot anomalies, fail fast on corrupt data, and archive reports without manual triage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend the ingestion workflow (`scripts/kg_build.py` and supporting CLI entrypoints) to emit a structured QA report per run with chunk counts, token histograms, orphan/node integrity checks, and embedding dimension validation, persisted under `artifacts/ingestion/<timestamp>/` alongside a human-readable summary. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Stories] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Minimal Path Workflow]
2. Introduce severity thresholds (configurable via settings/flags) that fail the ingestion pipeline with a non-zero exit code when anomalies breach limits (e.g., missing embeddings, orphan rate, checksum mismatches), logging remediation hints while preventing partial graph writes. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Enhancement Details] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Script Conventions]
3. Sanitize telemetry artefacts and structured logs so operators receive a concise summary (success/fail status, counts, file paths) without leaking secrets, and document the workflow in architecture/README shards. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Success criteria] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging Guidance]
4. Add unit and integration coverage that exercises QA success/failure paths (including compose-backed smoke) and verifies artefact generation is wired into the CI hooks under `artifacts/ingestion/`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Instrument `scripts/kg_build.py` (or dedicated QA module) to capture per-run chunk/embedding metrics and serialize JSON + Markdown summaries to `artifacts/ingestion/<timestamp>/quality_report.*`. (AC: 1) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Minimal Path Workflow]
  - [x] Record totals for processed files, chunks, token histogram bins, orphan counts, and embedding validation outcomes using existing metadata persisted by Story 3.1. (AC: 1) [Source: docs/stories/3.1.adaptive-chunking.md#Dev Agent Record]
- [x] Implement configurable thresholds (CLI flags + settings) that evaluate QA metrics, abort on failures, and emit actionable remediation messages while keeping writes idempotent. (AC: 2) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Script Conventions]
  - [x] Ensure gating integrates with existing structured logging (`structlog`/JSON) and returns non-zero exit codes on failure. (AC: 2,3) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging Guidance]
  - [x] Execute QA validation before committing Neo4j/Qdrant writes (or perform transactional rollback) so failed gates leave no partial graph state. (AC: 2) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Minimal Path Workflow] [Source: docs/qa/assessments/3.2-risk-20251002.md]
- [x] Update CLI/docs to reference QA artefact locations, sanitization expectations, and CI wiring so operators can locate reports quickly. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook]
- [x] Add pytest coverage (unit + integration) that stubs anomaly scenarios, validates artefact creation, and runs the compose smoke to ensure gating works against heterogeneous corpora. (AC: 4) [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations]
  - [x] Wire new tests into existing GitHub Actions smoke workflow and document execution commands. (AC: 4) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Local Stack Automation]
- [x] Refresh developer documentation (README, architecture shards) with QA telemetry instructions and troubleshooting guidance. (AC: 3) [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Built-In Tool Playbook]

## Dev Notes
### Override Notice
- Override recorded on 2025-10-02 to unblock QA instrumentation while Story 3.1 awaited review; Story 3.1 is now `Done`, log retained in `docs/bmad/story-overrides.md` for traceability. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Story Override Workflow] [Source: docs/stories/3.1.adaptive-chunking.md#Status] [Source: docs/bmad/story-overrides.md]

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.1 added deterministic directory ingestion, per-chunk metadata (relative path, git commit, checksum), and profile-aware chunking—reuse these fields when assembling QA metrics and reports. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.adaptive-chunking.md#Dev Agent Record]

### QA Telemetry Targets
- QA must surface chunk/token statistics, orphan integrity, and embedding dimension validation before export/retrieval, mirroring the epic goals for adaptive pipelines. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Epic Description]

### Data Models & Persistence
- Neo4j `Chunk` nodes already store metadata/embeddings; ensure QA queries leverage existing schemas without altering vector index contracts. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Database & Collection Schema]
- Qdrant payloads retain `neo4j_id` linking; QA artefacts should confirm payload readiness prior to export. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Database & Collection Schema]

### CLI & Logging Guidance
- Continue using structured logging (`structlog`/JSON) with operation, duration, and status fields, adding new QA summary entries without exposing secrets. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging Guidance]
- Gating logic should exit non-zero on failure and provide remediation hints consistent with existing script conventions. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Script Conventions]

### Project Structure Notes
- Place new QA modules alongside existing ingestion scripts under `scripts/` or `src/cli/` per current source tree layout. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Source Tree Blueprint]
- Persist artefacts beneath `artifacts/ingestion/` to align with established directory structure for pipeline outputs. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Enhancement Details]

### Testing Requirements
- Tests must live under `tests/unit/scripts/` and `tests/integration/local_stack/`, exercising new QA logic with mocks and compose-backed smoke coverage. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations] [Source: docs/architecture/overview.md#Local Stack Automation]
- Follow pytest-based patterns and reuse existing fixtures for Neo4j/Qdrant/OpenAI to avoid duplicating setup. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Expectations]

### Observability & CI
- Document commands so GitHub Actions workflows can archive QA artefacts and surface failure summaries, maintaining traceability promised in the epic success criteria. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/ingestion-quality/epic.md#Success criteria]
- Version QA report outputs (e.g., `ingestion-qa-report/v1` JSON + Markdown schema) so CI consumers can detect drift and validate expected fields. [Source: docs/qa/assessments/3.2-risk-20251002.md]

- Unit tests: validate QA metric collection for successful runs, ensuring JSON/Markdown reports capture chunks, tokens, orphan checks, and embedding validation outputs. (AC 1,4)
- Unit tests: simulate anomaly thresholds (e.g., missing embeddings, orphan rate spike) to confirm gating raises structured exceptions and exits non-zero with remediation hints. (AC 2,4)
- Integration test: run compose-backed ingestion with mixed corpus to ensure QA artefacts land in `artifacts/ingestion/` and logs summarize results without leaking secrets. (AC 1,3,4)
- CI wiring: update GitHub Actions smoke workflow to collect QA artefacts and mark runs failed when gating trips. (AC 3,4)
- Test execution: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_kg_build.py`
