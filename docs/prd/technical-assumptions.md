# Technical Assumptions

- Repository structure: Monorepo with CLI scripts, Docker Compose files, configuration modules, and documentation.
- Service architecture: Python CLI orchestrator interacts with local Dockerized Neo4j and Qdrant services by default; environment variables can redirect to managed clusters later.
- Testing requirements: Unit coverage for helper utilities plus an integration smoke test that seeds sample text, runs the pipeline, and verifies a grounded answer.
- Tooling preferences:
  - Python 3.12 with optional `pip-tools` or `uv` for lockfile management.
  - Neo4j Python driver 5.x, Qdrant client â‰¥ 1.8, OpenAI SDK 1.x.
  - Logging via `structlog` or standard `logging` with JSON output.
- Infrastructure expectations: Compose stack listens on localhost (`7474`, `7687`, `6333`); volumes persisted under `./.data/{neo4j,qdrant}`; API keys injected through `.env` without committing secrets.
