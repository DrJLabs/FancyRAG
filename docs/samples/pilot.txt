Acme Corp launched GraphRAG Pilot on May 14, 2025 to accelerate knowledge graph experimentation.
The pilot ingests internal architecture memos, product FAQs, and public release notes into Neo4j.
Operators run create_vector_index.py followed by kg_build.py to generate Document and Chunk nodes.
Each ingestion stores embeddings on Chunk.embedding with 1024 dimensions using cosine similarity.
Generated metrics and sanitized logs feed into artifacts/local_stack for smoke and CI validation.
